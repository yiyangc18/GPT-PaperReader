It is a significant task to re-sequence orders and group orders with identical color as a color batch to minimize the color changeover costs. In this paper, a Color-batching Resequencing Problem (CRP) with mix bank buffer systems is considered. We propose a Color-Histogram (CH) model to describe the CRP as a Markov decision process and a Deep Q-Network (DQN) algorithm to solve the CRP integrated with the virtual car resequencing technique. The CH model significantly reduces the number of possible actions of the DQN agent, so that the DQN algorithm can be applied to the CRP at a practical scale. A DQN agent is trained in a deep reinforcement learning environment to minimize the costs of color changeovers for the CRP. Two experiments with different assumptions on the order attribute distributions and cost metrics were conducted and evaluated. Experimental results show that the proposed approach outperformed conventional algorithms under both conditions. The proposed agent can run in real time on a regular personal computer with a GPU. Hence, the proposed approach can be readily applied in the production control of automotive paint shops to resolve order-resequencing problems.									20	1	0	0	0	0	21			0278-6125	1878-6642										Dalian Univ Technol, Sch Econ & Management, Dalian, Peoples R ChinaBMW Brilliance Automot Ltd, Shenyang, Peoples R ChinaNortheastern Univ, Sch Mech Engn & Automat, Shenyang, Peoples R China				2020-10-06	WOS:000571676600014		
J	Zhou, Juanying; Zhao, Jianyou; Wang, Lufeng				Jiang, Cheng/JHU-0179-2023						An Energy Management Strategy of Power-Split Hybrid Electric Vehicles Using Reinforcement Learning								MOBILE INFORMATION SYSTEMS				2022						9731828			10.1155/2022/9731828							Article	APR 21 2022	2022	With the rapid development of science and technology, the automobile industry is also gradually expanding due to which energy security and ecological security are seriously threatened. This paper was aimed at studying the energy organization strategy of power-split hybrid electric vehicles based on a reinforcement learning algorithm. A power-split hybrid electric vehicle (HEV) combines the advantages of both series and parallel hybrid vehicle architectures by using a planetary gear set to split and combine the power generated by electric machines and a combustion engine. This improves the fuel economy to some extent. However, to increase the fuel economy to a greater extent. This study primarily introduces the hybrid electric vehicle's structure and presents a reinforcement learning-based management of energy approach for hybrid electric vehicles. It constructs the vehicle power model of HEV and Markov probability transfer model, then designs the energy control strategy based on reinforcement learning, and finally compares it with the energy control strategy based on PID (Proportional-IntegralDerivative). Using MATLAB/Simulink, the cycle conditions of NEDC (New European Driving Cycle) and FTP-75 (Federal Test Procedure) are selected to carry out simulation experiments. The energy management technique suggested in this study, which is based on reinforcement learning, may efficiently enhance the usage rate of automotive gasoline. The replication results show that the fuel consumption per 100 km (kilometers) based on reinforcement learning management strategy is 4.6% and 2.7% lower than the PID management strategy under two working conditions. The economy of fuel of the hybrid electric vehicle is also effectively improved.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1574-017X	1875-905X										Changan Univ, Sch Automobile, Xian 710064, Shaanxi, Peoples R ChinaShaanxi Vocat & Tech Coll, Coll Automot Engn & Gen Aviat, Xian 710038, Shaanxi, Peoples R ChinaShaanxi Coll Commun Technol, Coll Automobile, Xian 710018, Shaanxi, Peoples R China	Shaanxi Vocat & Tech CollShaanxi Coll Commun Technol			2022-08-07	WOS:000832163500005

These questions are especially pertinent in small and medium-sized enterprises and automotive industry companies that operate through supply chains, where knowledge about customers is likely to result from personal contact between customers and organisational members. The purpose of this paper is to analyse the extent to which these managerial actions were more likely to lead to the successful creation of CC.Design/methodology/approach - Using the partial least squares technique, this paper studies how these three managerial actions impact on CC. To do so, data from 140 companies in the Spanish automotive components manufacturing sector have been used.Findings - The findings support the influence of RL on both GIP and CC. RL is a key managerial action in exploiting customer information and knowledge advantages, enabling firms to structure and reconfigure resources to produce new ways to compete and to satisfy stakeholders. In addition, results show that GIP is a determinant of CC because of its contribution to achieving sustainable competitive advantage, with GIP performing a mediating role in the relationship between RL and CC. A second contribution shows that IT is not in itself able to yield a competitive advantage, thereby validating the existence of complementary or co-focused strategic assets such as RL and GIP, which enhance IT's influence on CC.Research limitations/implications - The authors were unable to explore the subtleties of the processes over time. Future research should include a longitudinal study.Practical implications - This study considers RL an essential factor in achieving both GIP and CC. Consequently, managers should seek to build strong RL cultures. In addition, this study shows that IT is not in itself able to yield a competitive advantage, thereby validating the existence of complementary or co-focused strategic assets such as RL and GIP.Originality/value - No study has ever examined these three antecedent variables (IT, RL and GIP) together, with the aim to examine their effects on CC.									70	1	0	1	1	0	76			1367-3270	1758-7484										Univ Seville, Dept Business Adm & Mkt, Seville, SpainUniv Loyola Andalucia, Seville, SpainUniv Seville, Seville, Spain				2016-01-01	WOS:000379818700003

The ideal energy management controller that minimizes HEV energy costs needs to run engines most efficiently in the whole running considering battery SoC. The controller needs to predict the future vehicle speed and plan the power distribution to achieve it because the thermal efficiency of engines is more efficient when its rotational speed is higher. The future vehicle speed has relationship with connectivity information such as the behavior of the car in front, the traffic light signals, crowd of cars, and so on. This paper assumes the connectivity environment in the future and applies proximal policy optimization (PPO) [5] that is known as policy-based deep reinforcement learning algorithm to achieve the optimal power distribution predicting the future behavior by using connectivity information. In addition, this paper shows that locating the local controller in the reinforcement learning loop enables the AI controller to learn robustly. The local controller corrects against an exploration that is obviously not optimal or doesn't satisfy the constraints.					16th IEEE Vehicle Power and Propulsion Conference (VPPC)16th IEEE Vehicle Power and Propulsion Conference (VPPC)	OCT 14-17, 2019OCT 14-17, 2019	IEEE; Bach Khoa; CTI; Univ Tokyo; IEEE VTSIEEE; Bach Khoa; CTI; Univ Tokyo; IEEE VTS	Hanoi, VIETNAMHanoi, VIETNAM	11	0	0	0	0	0	11			1938-8756		978-1-7281-1249-7									Sophia Univ, Dept Sci & Technol, Tokyo, Japan				2020-05-27	WOS:000532785000183

Reinforcement Learning for Joint V2I Network Selection and Autonomous Driving Policies								GLOBECOM 2022 - 2022 IEEE Global Communications Conference								1241	6				10.1109/GLOBECOM48099.2022.10001396							Conference Paper	2022	2022	Vehicle-to-Infrastructure (V2I) communication is becoming critical for the enhanced reliability of autonomous vehicles (AVs). However, the uncertainties in the road-traffic and AVs' wireless connections can severely impair timely decision-making. It is thus critical to simultaneously optimize the AVs' network selection and driving policies in order to minimize road collisions while maximizing the communication data rates. In this paper, we develop a reinforcement learning (RL) framework to characterize efficient network selection and autonomous driving policies in a multi-band vehicular network (VNet) operating on conventional sub-6GHz spectrum and Terahertz (THz) frequencies. The proposed framework is designed to (i) maximize the traffic flow and minimize collisions by controlling the vehicle's motion dynamics (i.e., speed and acceleration) from autonomous driving perspective, and (ii) maximize the data rates and minimize handoffs by jointly controlling the vehicle's motion dynamics and network selection from telecommunication perspective. We cast this problem as a Markov Decision Process (MDP) and develop a deep Q-learning based solution to optimize the actions such as acceleration, deceleration, lane-changes, and AV-base station assignments for a given AV's state. The AV's state is defined based on the velocities and communication channel states of AVs. Numerical results demonstrate interesting insights related to the inter-dependency of vehicle's motion dynamics, handoffs, and the communication data rate. The proposed policies enable AVs to adopt safe driving behaviors with improved connectivity.

The goodness of the planned trajectory is evaluated by driving the vehicle along the track. The paper shows that this encapsulated problem and environment provides a one-step reinforcement learning task with continuous actions that can be handled with Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient learning agent. The solution of the problem provides a real-time neural network-based motion planner along with a tracking algorithm, and since the trained network provides a preliminary estimate on the expected reward of the current state-action pair, the system acts as a trajectory feasibility estimator as well.					16th International Conference on Informatics in Control, Automation and Robotics (ICINCO)16th International Conference on Informatics in Control, Automation and Robotics (ICINCO)	JUL 29-31, 2019JUL 29-31, 2019		Prague, CZECH REPUBLICPrague, CZECH REPUBLIC	6	0	0	0	0	0	6					978-989-758-380-3									Budapest Univ Technol & Econ, Dept Control Transportat & Vehicle Syst, Budapest, HungaryHungarian Acad Sci, Comp & Automat Res Inst, Budapest, Hungary				2020-10-08	WOS:000571063100049

The latency constraints of modern automotive applications make it difficult to run complex applications on vehicle on-board units (OBUs). While multi-access edge computing (MEC) can facilitate task offloading to execute these applications, it is still a challenge to access them promptly and optimally. Traditional algorithms struggle to guarantee accuracy in such dynamic environment, but deep reinforcement learning (DRL) methods offer improved accuracy, robustness, and real-time decision-making capabilities. In this paper, we propose a DRL-based mobility, contact, and load aware cooperative task offloading (DCTO) scheme. DCTO is designed for both cellular and mmWave radio access technologies (RATs), and both binary and partial offloading mechanisms. DCTO targets delay minimization by opportunistically switching RATs and offloading mechanisms. We consider relative efficacy and neutrality factors as key performance indicators and use them to derive the DRL agent's reward function. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that the DCTO scheme exhibits a substantial enhancement in task success rate, with an increase from 2.61% to 21.34%. It also improves the efficacy factor from 1.38 to 3.52 and reduces the neutrality factor from 4.99 to 0.76. Furthermore, the average task processing time is reduced by a range of 3.77% to 24.15%. Additionally, the DCTO scheme outperforms the other evaluated schemes in terms of reward and TFPS ratio.(c) 2023 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier B.V. on behalf of King Saud University.

J	Zhaojian Li; Tianshu Chu; Kolmanovsky, I.V.; Xiang Yin; Xunyuan Yin										Cloud Resource Allocation for Cloud-Based Automotive Applications [arXiv]								arXiv								10 pp.	10 pp.											Journal Paper	17 Jan. 2017	2017	There is a rapidly growing interest in the use of cloud computing for automotive vehicles to facilitate computation and data intensive tasks. Efficient utilization of on-demand cloud resources holds a significant potential to improve future vehicle safety, comfort, and fuel economy. In the meanwhile, issues like cyber security and resource allocation pose great challenges. In this paper, we treat the resource allocation problem for cloud-based automotive systems. Both private and public cloud paradigms are considered where a private cloud provides an internal, company-owned internet service dedicated to its own vehicles while a public cloud serves all subscribed vehicles. This paper establishes comprehensive models of cloud resource provisioning for both private and public cloud-based automotive systems. Complications such as stochastic communication delays and task deadlines are explicitly considered. In particular, a centralized resource provisioning model is developed for private cloud and chance constrained optimization is exploited to utilize the cloud resources for best Quality of Services. On the other hand, a decentralized auction-based model is developed for public cloud and reinforcement learning is employed to obtain an optimal bidding policy for a "selfish" agent. Numerical examples are presented to illustrate the effectiveness of the developed techniques.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0														Dept. of Aerosp.

To efficiently train the controller, a control-oriented simulation model for a vehicle with combustion engine, automatic gear box and hydraulic brake system has been developed. In addition, to enhance the reinforcement learning-based controller, we have incorporated preview information in the feedback state to better deal with the delays. We present our approach of designing a reward function which enables the reinforcement learning-based controller to solve the problem. The controller is trained using the Soft Actor-Critic algorithm by incorporating the developed simulation model. Finally, the performance and robustness is evaluated in simulation. Our controller is able to follow an unseen path and is robust against variations in the vehicle parameters, in our case an additional payload.					31st IEEE Intelligent Vehicles Symposium (IV)31st IEEE Intelligent Vehicles Symposium (IV)	JUN 23-26, 2020JUN 23-26, 2020	IEEEIEEE	ELECTR NETWORKELECTR NETWORK	5	0	0	0	0	0	5			1931-0587		978-1-7281-6673-5									German Aerosp Ctr DLR, Inst Syst Dynam & Control, Munchener Str 20, D-82234 Wessling, Germany				2021-06-24	WOS:000653124200082

Modular Production Control with Multi-Agent Deep Q-Learning								2021 26th IEEE International Conference on Emerging Technologies and Factory Automation (ETFA )								8 pp.	8 pp.				10.1109/ETFA45728.2021.9613177							Conference Paper	2021	2021	The automotive industry is increasingly focusing on product customization. The concept of Modular Production addresses this issue by providing more flexibility in production with Automated Guided Vehicles transporting products between modular workstations. The added complexity of Modular Production Control calls for approaches that can handle the scheduling complexity while also minimizing production costs. As a result, literature has focused on two promising approaches: Deep Reinforcement Learning and Multi-Agent Systems. Both approaches have their advantages. Especially in complex, large-scale production environments with random breakdowns, those two fields have been seldomly combined, though. As a result, this article aims to fill that research gap by introducing a Deep Reinforcement Learning Multi-Agent System approach for Modular Production Control. We introduce a reward design incentivizing agents to achieve maximal throughput. In addition, we show that the method learns optimal behavior even in a large-scale production environment with random machine breakdowns. Lastly, we compare the Multi-Agent System to a single-agent implementation of the Deep Reinforcement Learning approach and conclude that the Multi-Agent Deep Reinforcement Learning method learns and solves the Modular Production Control problem with the same solution quality as the single agent. Hence, the approach allows to foster MAS benefits such as robustness without losses in the solution quality.					2021 IEEE 26th International Conference on Emerging Technologies and Factory Automation (ETFA)2021 IEEE 26th International Conference on Emerging Technologies and Factory Automation (ETFA)	7-10 Sept. 20217-10 Sept. 2021		Vasteras, SwedenVasteras, Sweden	0	0	0	0	0	0	0					978-1-7281-2989-1									Munchen Inst. of Autom. & Inf.

The first step of the current research is to train a reinforcement learning agent in a simulated environment, where the conditions and the applied vehicle are modeled. System dynamics is described by a nonlinear single-track vehicle with dynamic wheel model. The designed trajectory is evaluated by driving the vehicle using a control loop. The reward of the method is based on the sum of different measures considering safety and passenger comfort. The proposed method forms a special one-step reinforcement learning task handled by Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG) learning agent. As a result, the learning process provides a real-time neural-network-based motion planner and a tracking algorithm. The evaluation of the algorithm under real conditions is made by using an experimental test vehicle. The test setup contains a high precision GPS module, an automotive inertial sensor, an industrial PC, and communication interface devices. The test cases were performed on the ZalaZone automotive proving ground.					18th European Control Conference (ECC)18th European Control Conference (ECC)	MAY 12-15, 2020MAY 12-15, 2020	European Control Assoc; Int Federat Automat Control; IEEE CSS; MathWorks; ProcessesEuropean Control Assoc; Int Federat Automat Control; IEEE CSS; MathWorks; Processes	ITMO Univ St Petersburg, ELECTR NETWORKITMO Univ St Petersburg, ELECTR NETWORK	4	1	0	0	0	0	5					978-3-90714-402-2									Budapest Univ Technol & Econ, Dept Control Transportat & Vehicle Syst, Muegyet Rkp 3, H-1111 Budapest, HungaryBudapest Univ Technol & Econ, Dept Automot Technol, Budapest, Hungary				2021-02-25	WOS:000613138000063

In this paper, we consider a spectrum utilization problem, in which a number of co-existing cellular users (CUs) and prioritized device-to-device (D2D) users are equipped in a single antenna vehicle-mounted communication network. To ensure a business-aware spectrum access mechanism with delay granted in a complex dynamic environment, we consider optimizing a metric that maintains a trade off between maximizing the total capacity of vehicle to vehicle (V2V) and vehicle to infrastructure (V2I) links and minimizing the interference of high priority links. A low complexity priority-based spectrum allocation scheme based on the deep reinforcement learning method is developed to solve the proposed formulation. We trained our algorithm using the deep Q-learning network (DQN) over a set of public bandwidths. Simulation results show that the proposed scheme can allocate spectrum resources quickly and effectively in a high dynamic vehicle network environment. Concerning improved channel transmission rate, the V2V link rate in this scheme is 2.54 times that of the traditional random spectrum allocation scheme, and the V2I link rate is 13.5% higher than that of the traditional random spectrum allocation scheme. The average total interference received by priority links decreased by 14.2 dB compared to common links, realized service priority distinction and has good robustness to communication noise.									7	0	0	0	0	0	7				2076-3417										Yunnan Univ, Sch Informat Sci & Engn, Kunming 650500, Yunnan, Peoples R China				2022-02-27	WOS:000756133100001

Smart OTA Scheduling for Connected Vehicles using Prescriptive Analytics and Deep Reinforcement Learning								SAE Technical Papers								2022	01-1045				10.4271/2022-01-1045							Conference Proceedings	2022	2022	OTA (over the air) updates help automotive manufacturers to reduce vehicle warranty and recall costs. Vehicle recall is expensive, and many automotive manufacturers have implemented OTA updates. Updating parameters for connected vehicles can be challenging when dealing with thousands of vehicles across different regions. For example, how does the manufacturer prioritise which vehicles need updating? Environmental and geographical factors affect degradation rates and vehicles in hotter regions or congested cities may degrade faster. For EVs, updating the BMS (battery management system) parameters requires careful analysis prior to the update being deployed, to maximise impact and reduce the likelihood of adverse behaviour being introduced. The analysis overhead increases with the number of vehicles. This is because it requires simulation and optimisation of the fleet BMS calibration in a digital twin environment. A targeted approach is the best option to prioritise vehicles for software updates. Smart OTA scheduling makes use of predictive analytics for battery health prediction together with prescriptive analytics in a smart decision engine. The smart scheduling system uses a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) agent in a digital twin environment. The DRL agent can learn and simulate different scenarios and identify the best update sequence depending on monthly temperature profile, traffic congestion, and many other factors to slow down the degradation of fleet health. Whenever there is an update, the DRL agent assesses the situation and recommends the appropriate action to minimise vehicle failures and maintain fleet health. In a large-scale simulation, this approach improved average fleet battery life by 8 to 13% and increased average vehicle range by 2%.

A Long-term Energy Management Strategy for Fuel Cell Electric Vehicles Using Reinforcement Learning								FUEL CELLS				20	6	SI		753	761				10.1002/fuce.202000095					OCT 2020		Article; Early Access		2020	The two power sources of a fuel cell electric vehicle (FCEV) are proton electrolyte membrane fuel cell (PEMFC) and Li-ion battery (LIB). The health status of PEMFC and LIB decreases with the use of FCEV, so the energy management strategy (EMS) needs to give an optimal power distribution based on the health status of power sources throughout the lifetime. However, rule-based control strategies cannot achieve this. To prolong the service lifetime of two power sources by optimizing power distribution, this article proposes a long-term energy management strategy (LTEMS) for FCEV, which contains a reinforcement learning module and an improved thermostat controller. By designing a reward function, the reinforcement learning module outputted various LIB state of charge (SOC) boundary which changes with power source attenuation. Based on SOC boundary, the improved thermostat controller will control the fuel cell current under specific driving conditions. Simulation was carried out based on different LIB state of health (SOH) and external temperature, and the simulation results were compared with the data collected from FCEV under rule-based (RB) strategies. It can be found that the proposed LTEMS can effectively reduce fuel cell and LIB attenuation, and meet the FCEV power demand.									21	1	0	0	0	0	22			1615-6846	1615-6854										Dalian Univ Technol, State Key Lab Struct Anal Ind Equipment, Fac Vehicle Engn & Mech, Sch Automot Engn, Dalian 116024, Peoples R China				2020-11-09	WOS:000582544900001

Safe Trajectory Planning Using Reinforcement Learning for Self Driving [arXiv]								arXiv								7 pp.	7 pp.											Journal Paper	9 Nov. 2020	2020	Self-driving vehicles must be able to act intelligently in diverse and difficult environments, marked by high-dimensional state spaces, a myriad of optimization objectives and complex behaviors. Traditionally, classical optimization and search techniques have been applied to the problem of self-driving; but they do not fully address operations in environments with high-dimensional states and complex behaviors. Recently, imitation learning has been proposed for the task of self-driving; but it is labor-intensive to obtain enough training data. Reinforcement learning has been proposed as a way to directly control the car, but this has safety and comfort concerns. We propose using model-free reinforcement learning for the trajectory planning stage of self-driving and show that this approach allows us to operate the car in a more safe, general and comfortable manner, required for the task of self driving.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0														Dept. of Comput.

The goal of the EB-CFP problem is to determine the number and type of EB chargers that should be deployed at bus terminals and depots to meet daily EB charging demand while minimizing total cost. The problem is formulated as a two-stage stochastic programming model, with the first stage determining the EB charger deployment scheme and the second stage estimating the EB daily operational cost with respect to a predetermined EB trip timetable for a given EB charger deployment scheme. To effectively address the second stage problem, a multi -agent EB transit simulation system that mimics the daily EB operation process is developed. We then design two heuristic methods, the reinforcement learning (RL)-based method and the surrogate-based optimization (SBO), that use the developed multi-agent EB transit simulation system to solve the two-stage stochastic programming model for large-scale instances.

In this category we include a set of technological resources, both hardware and software applications, which support different utilization characteristics of knowledge and relational learning (RL) activities, such as: business intelligence, technologies for collaborating and distributing knowledge, knowledge generation and storage, and support hardware for these technologies. An emerging stream of research on IT and RL seeks to guide the application of technologies that support RL. IT is involved in the various knowledge management processes, which include knowledge creation. A great variety of procedures, tools and activities may act as a support to the knowledge generation and creation process. IT contributes to sustainable competitive advantage through its interaction with other resources. Recent literature suggests that RL is a process that plays an important role in enhancing a firm's capabilities and competitive advantage and which may benefit from the judicious application of IT. It has also been argued that for firms to be successful they must complement IT with RL. This study aims to assess the role played by information technology (IT) in relational learning activities (RL). We also examine how IT and RL influence both green innovations (GI) and the development of the customer capital (CC). These relationships have been tested via an empirical analysis carried out with a sample of industrial companies belonging to the Spanish automotive industry. Our findings allow us to confirm that IT acts as an enabler of the RL process and influences on the development of GI, which allow the achievement of a better customer capital (CC).					7th European Conference on Intellectual Capital (ECIC)7th European Conference on Intellectual Capital (ECIC)	APR 09-10, 2015APR 09-10, 2015		Tech Univ Cartagena, SPAINTech Univ Cartagena, SPAIN	0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2049-0933		978-1-910810-01-9									Univ Seville, Business Management & Mkt Dept, Seville, SpainLoyola Andalucia Univ, Business Management Dept, Seville, Spain				2015-08-26	WOS:000359062600025

This connectivity is changing the automotive world. With the speedy growth and densification of vehicles in Internet of Vehicles (IoV) technology, the need for consistency in communication amongst vehicles becomes more significant. This technology needs to be scalable, secure, and flexible when connecting products and services. 5G technology, with its incredible speed, is expected to power the future of vehicular networks. Owing to high mobility and constant change in the topology, cooperative intelligent transport systems ensure real time connectivity between vehicles. For ensuring a seamless connectivity amongst the entities in vehicular networks, a significant alternative to design is support of handoff. This paper proposes a scheme for the best Road Side Unit (RSU) selection during handoff. Authentication and security of the vehicles are ensured using the Deep Sparse Stacked Autoencoder Network (DS2AN) algorithm, developed using a deep learning model. Once authenticated, resource allocation by RSU to the vehicle is accomplished through Deep-Q learning (DQL) techniques. Compared with the existing handoff schemes, Reinforcement Learning based on the MDP (RL-MDP) has been found to have a 13% lesser decision delay for selecting the best RSU. A higher level of security and minimum time requirement for authentication is achieved using DS2AN. The proposed system simulation results demonstrate that it ensures reliable packet delivery, significantly improving system throughput, upholding tolerable delay levels during a change of RSUs.									16	0	0	0	1	0	16				1996-1073										BMS Coll Engn, Dept Elect & Commun Engn, Bengaluru 560019, IndiaUmm Al Qura Univ, Coll Comp & Informat Syst, Dept Comp Sci, Mecca 21955, Saudi ArabiaAl Nahrain Univ, Al Nahrain Nanorenewable Energy Res Ctr, Baghdad 10001, IraqTaif Univ, Coll Comp & Informat Technol, Dept Informat Technol, At Taif 21944, Saudi Arabia				2022-04-07	WOS:000775445800001

Due to multi-variant products, changing customer demands, and dynamic environments the process of generating planned orders is challenging. This paper introduces an approach using graphical models to generate planned order suggestions in a multi-variant order management process. Bayesian networks are modelled by learning the structure from different data sources, which enable the possibility to directly sample configuration suggestions. To find an optimized graph structure, a method using hierarchical correlation clustering and reinforcement learning is applied, taking into account technical and sales-operated feasibility constraints.

Firms encounter RI implementation challenges from different stakeholders, both internally and externally. On the one hand, various governmental agencies are coming out with different environmental regulations while on the other hand academics and researchers are contributing solutions and suggestions in different country contexts. In a real sense however, the benefits of RL implementation is not yet fully realized in the emerging economies. This paper proposes a theoretical RL implementation model and empirically identifies significant RL barriers with respect to management, financial, policy and infrastructure in the Chinese manufacturing industries such as automotive, electrical and electronic, plastics, steel/construction, textiles and paper and paper based products. Key barriers from our study, with respect to these four categories, are: within management category a lack of reverse logistics experts and low commitment, within financial category a lack of initial capital and funds for return monitoring systems, within policy category a lack of enforceable laws and government supportive economic policies and, finally, within infrastructure category a the lack of systems for return monitoring. Contingency effect of ownership was carried out to understand the similarities and differences in RL barriers among the multinational firms and domestic firms investigated. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Time Series Prediction Integrated RNN-DRL for Energy-Emission Management in HEVs								2023 7th CAA International Conference on Vehicular Control and Intelligence (CVCI)								1	6				10.1109/CVCI59596.2023.10397382							Conference Paper	2023	2023	Learning-based strategies have gained widespread adoption in the field of energy management strategy (EMS) for hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs). However, existing algorithms often struggle to maintain the effectiveness in different driving scenarios. Additionally, achieving a fully observable Markov decision process in real-world situations is impractical due to the limitation in sensor sensitivity and noise. Therefore, it is crucial to design a stable EMS for HEVs that can adapt to various driving scenarios. This paper proposes a novel approach called the twin-delayed deep deterministic policy gradient with a long-short-term combined algorithm. It aims to enhance the generalization performance and EMS capability of HEVs' learning-based EMS by integrating temporal predicted information using a recurrent neural network. Comparing this algorithm with other established deep reinforcement learning algorithms, the results demonstrate significant improvements in EMS performance for HEVs, including state of charge maintenance, energy conservation, and emission reduction. Notably, the algorithm achieves these improvements while ensuring robust generalization across diverse driving cycles and scenarios.					2023 7th CAA International Conference on Vehicular Control and Intelligence (CVCI)2023 7th CAA International Conference on Vehicular Control and Intelligence (CVCI)	20232023		Changsha, ChinaChangsha, China	0	0	0	0	0	0	0					979-8-3503-4048-8									Clean Energy Automotive Eng.

In addition to the technical constraints in the implementation of these functions, a major challenge is the verification of functional safety. Conventional approaches aiming at statistical validation in the sense of real test drives are reaching their economic limits. On the other hand, there are simulation methods that allow a lot of freedom in test case design, but whose representativeness and relevance must be proven separately. In this paper an approach is presented that allows to generate critical concrete scenarios and test cases for automated driving functions by means of a reinforcement learning based optimization using here the example of an overtaking assistant. For this purpose, a Q-Learning approach is used that automates the parameter generation for the test cases. While pure combinatorics of the variable parameters leads to an unmanageable amount of test cases, the percentage of actually relevant critical test cases is very low. In this work we show how the share of critical and thus relevant test cases can be increased significantly by using the presented method compared to a purely combinatorial parameter variation.

The environment model for the surrounding traffic uses microscopic simulation to provide different situations for the agent. The environment sensing model is based on high-level sensor information, e.g. the odometry, lane position and surrounding vehicle states that can be reached from the current automotive sensors, such as camera and radar based systems. The objectives were reached through the definition of a rewarding system, with subrewards and penalties enforcing desired speed, lane keeping, keeping right and avoiding collision. After the description of the theoretical basis the environment model with the reward function is detailed. Finally the experiments with the learning process are presented and the results of the evaluation are given from some aspects of control quality and safety.					2nd IEEE Conference on Control Technology and Applications (CCTA)2nd IEEE Conference on Control Technology and Applications (CCTA)	AUG 21-24, 2018AUG 21-24, 2018	IEEE; IEEE Control Syst SocIEEE; IEEE Control Syst Soc	Copenhagen, DENMARKCopenhagen, DENMARK	15	0	0	0	0	0	15					978-1-5386-7698-1									Budapest Univ Technol & Econ, Dept Control Transportat & Vehicle Syst, H-1111 Budapest, HungaryHungarian Acad Sci, Syst & Control Lab, Comp & Automat Res Inst, Kende U 13-17, H-1111 Budapest, Hungary				2019-03-28	WOS:000461414700105

Manual calibration has the disadvantage of high work intensity, long calibration period and high technical requirement, which leads to low calibration accuracy and motor efficiency. Thus, a novel calibration method based on Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) is proposed. By constructing a deep reinforcement learning network, the self-optimization of the optimal working point under any working condition is realized, and the MAP for IPMSM in full speed-torque range is obtained. The method can be used to quickly realize the optimal matching of d-q axis current with arbitrary stator current. It focuses on solving the problem of motor overheating caused by long adjustment time of manually calibrated MAP when the motor is overloaded, to realize fast calibration in overload area. Moreover, the method reduces the dependence on the motor parameters and increases the adaptability of the calibration MAP data to the operating conditions. The simulation and bench test indicate that the method can meet the response requirements of motor torque, and results reveal that the motor efficiency is greatly improved.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1064-1246	1875-8967										Dalian Univ Technol, Sch Automot Engn, Fac Vehicle Engn & Mech, State Key Lab Struct Anal Ind Equipment, Dalian, Liaoning, Peoples R China				2020-08-03	WOS:000550223300005

KARNet: Kalman Filter Augmented Recurrent Neural Network for Learning World Models in Autonomous Driving Tasks [arXiv]								arXiv																				Journal Paper	23 May 2023	2023	Autonomous driving has received a great deal of attention in the automotive industry and is often seen as the future of transportation. The development of autonomous driving technology has been greatly accelerated by the growth of end-to-end machine learning techniques that have been successfully used for perception, planning, and control tasks. An important aspect of autonomous driving planning is knowing how the environment evolves in the immediate future and taking appropriate actions. An autonomous driving system should effectively use the information collected from the various sensors to form an abstract representation of the world to maintain situational awareness. For this purpose, deep learning models can be used to learn compact latent representations from a stream of incoming data. However, most deep learning models are trained end-to-end and do not incorporate any prior knowledge (e.g., from physics) of the vehicle in the architecture. In this direction, many works have explored physics-infused neural network (PINN) architectures to infuse physics models during training. Inspired by this observation, we present a Kalman filter augmented recurrent neural network architecture to learn the latent representation of the traffic flow using front camera images only. We demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed model in both imitation and reinforcement learning settings using both simulated and real-world datasets. The results show that incorporating an explicit model of the vehicle (states estimated using Kalman filtering) in the end-to-end learning significantly increases performance.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0																		2023-07-14	INSPEC:23356819

Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITSs) could be the key to finding solutions that drastically reduce these issues. The linked vehicular networks channel is a fast-expanding topic for workflow management system and development. Traffic detection is a big issue on city streets. To make informed decisions in order to prevent traffic jams, one of the solutions is the Vehicular Ad-Hoc Network (VANET). We describe an approach for detecting traffic jams in both vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) and vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) communication, which provides vehicle drivers with multiple alternatives for determining the location of congestion, its size, and how to prevent becoming stuck in a traffic jam. The data are sent to the driver to assist him in making the appropriate selection. Delivering Quality of Service (QoS) for automotive networks is a difficult challenge due to the characteristics such as terms of transmission or high mobility, congested and fragmented channels, hardware defects, and a large number of vehicular devices. As a result, it is extremely desired to get and distribute resources efficiently. This research uses Reinforcement Learning with Decision-Making Model (RLDMM) method to enhance channel allocation. By using latency, Signal-to-Interference Ratio (SIR) and QoS, the available channel is initially determined. This method is used to determine suitable channel for platoon members. As a result, the proposed RLDMM achieves an SINR reduction of 29 Db, 69 kbps of throughput, 21.4% of collision probability with 4ms of latency.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			1793-9623	1793-9615										Annamalai Univ, Div Comp & Informat Sci, Chidambaram, Tamilnadu, India				2023-01-12	WOS:000904789400001

This approach takes into account user historical driving and charging habits, user preferences, EV characteristics, city-scale mobility, EV charger availability and price, and grid capacity. The user preferences include the trade-off between cost and time to charge, as well as incentives to participate in different energy-saving programs. We leverage deep reinforcement learning (DRL) to make recommendations to EV drivers and optimize their welfare while enhancing grid performance.

However, the performance of such systems is a function of execution rate which demands on-board platform-level support.

It requires that all the tasks in a system meet their timing constraints. For an embedded complex system involving a number of subsystems, the timing properties of the subsystems play an important role, since the total system's response depends on the temporal behaviour of all the subsystems. In this paper, the timing properties of reactive programs written in a rule-based language RL are analyzed. RL is a relatively simple rule language for programming the discrete part of hybrid applications, implemented using a layered architecture. The language has already been used in prototyping a complex automotive application.The upper timing bounds for RL programs, executed using either of the two evaluation strategies, have been studied. Moreover, an analysis tool has been implemented and applied to derive the timing behaviour of a non-trivial application. Some comments on the temporal behaviour of a layered system, consisting of a discrete RL program combined with a set of periodic tasks, are given. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd.

We also examine potential absorptive capacity as an antecedent of realized absorptive capacity. In addition, we propose that relational learning (RL) will play a moderator role reinforcing the PACAP and RACAP link. Consequently, this paper builds and tests a conditional process model. Data was collected from a sample of 110 project managers of firms belonging to the Spanish automotive components manufacturing sector. Results from variance-based structural equation modeling and PROCESS tool show that RACAP fully mediates the influence of the PACAP on IO, and this indirect effect is positively conditioned by RL. This paper provides evidence that when RL achieves a low value, this indirect influence is not different from zero. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. APM and IPMA.

To assess the current technological advancements of machine vision systems and propose a technology maturity assessment framework, a nine-phase Systematic Literature Review (SLR) strategy was implemented. As the automotive industry stands at the forefront of autonomous systems, we analysed 85 works across the entire automotive manufacturing life cycle. The findings revealed that machine vision is utilised in each technological pillar of Industry 4.0, encompassing autonomous robots, augmented reality, predictive maintenance, additive manufacturing, and more. In analysing 22 vision-based applications in 47 automotive components, we clustered machine vision systems' architectural components and processing techniques, ranging from threshold-based methods to advanced reinforcement learning techniques suitable for the I5.0 environment. Leveraging the insights gathered, we propose the I5.0 technology maturity assessment framework for machine vision systems, evaluating nine functional components across five scaling technology levels. This framework serves as a valuable tool to identify weaknesses and opportunities for improvement, guiding machine vision integration into an intelligent factory.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			0020-7543	1366-588X										Democritus Univ Thrace, Dept Prod & Management Engn, 12 Vas Sophias, GR-67132 Xanthi, GreeceDemocritus Univ Thrace, Dept Elect & Comp Engn, Xanthi, Greece				2023-11-06	WOS:001088051500001		
J	Boettinger, M.; Klotz, D.										Mastering Nordschleife -- A comprehensive race simulation for AI strategy decision-making in motorsports [arXiv]								arXiv																				Journal Paper	28 June 2023	2023	In the realm of circuit motorsports, race strategy plays a pivotal role in determining race outcomes. This strategy focuses on the timing of pit stops, which are necessary due to fuel consumption and tire performance degradation. The objective of race strategy is to balance the advantages of pit stops, such as tire replacement and refueling, with the time loss incurred in the pit lane. Current race simulations, used to estimate the best possible race strategy, vary in granularity, modeling of probabilistic events, and require manual input for in-laps. This paper addresses these limitations by developing a novel simulation model tailored to GT racing and leveraging artificial intelligence to automate strategic decisions. By integrating the simulation with OpenAI's Gym framework, a reinforcement learning environment is created and an agent is trained. The study evaluates various hyperparameter configurations, observation spaces, and reward functions, drawing upon historical timing data from the 2020 N\"urburgring Langstrecken Serie for empirical parameter validation. The results demonstrate the potential of reinforcement learning for improving race strategy decision-making, as the trained agent makes sensible decisions regarding pit stop timing and refueling amounts. Key parameters, such as learning rate, decay rate and the number of episodes, are identified as crucial factors, while the combination of fuel mass and current race position proves most effective for policy development. The paper contributes to the broader application of reinforcement learning in race simulations and unlocks the potential for race strategy optimization beyond FIA Formula~1, specifically in the GT racing domain.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0																		2023-07-20	INSPEC:23396156

Responding to electricity demand and making reasonable use of power resources has become one of the solutions to this problem. In this paper, we propose the use of Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) technology to optimize the scheduling of user load Demand Response (DR). Firstly, we establish a comprehensive scheduling model of user load for both the power grid-load and user-load parts. We then add controllable loads, such as commonly used household appliances, user electric vehicles (EVs), and distributed photovoltaic (PV), to construct a load interaction environment. We also proposes that electric vehicles can charge and discharge flexibly based on real-time electricity prices to alleviate the burden of power grid scheduling and prioritize the consumption of distributed photovoltaics. Finally, we solve the Markov decision process and provide experimental evidence for the feasibility and effectiveness of deep reinforcement learning methods in solving the problem of user load demand response.					2023 3rd Power System and Green Energy Conference (PSGEC)2023 3rd Power System and Green Energy Conference (PSGEC)	24-26 Aug. 202324-26 Aug. 2023		Shanghai, ChinaShanghai, China	0	0	0	0	0	0	0					979-8-3503-4009-9									Linyi Power Supply Co., Linyi, China				2023-10-12	INSPEC:23786664

However, the insufficiency of accessible charging infrastructure remains a challenge, hindering the widespread adoption of EVs. To address this issue, we propose a novel approach to optimize the placement of charging stations within a road network, known as the charging station location problem (CSLP). Our method considers multiple factors, including fairness in charging station distribution, benefits associated with their placement, and drivers' discomfort. Fairness is quantified by the balance in charging station coverage across the network, while driver comfort is measured by the total time spent during the charging process. Then, the CSLP is formulated as a reinforcement learning problem, and we introduce a novel model called PPO-Attention. This model incorporates an attention layer into the Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) algorithm, enhancing the algorithm's capacity to identify and understand the intricate interdependencies between different nodes in the network. We have conducted extensive tests on urban road networks in Europe, North America, and Asia. The results demonstrate the superior performance of our approach compared to existing baseline algorithms. On average, our method achieves a profit increase of 258.04% and reduces waiting time by 73.40%, travel time by 18.46%, and charging time by 40.10%.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0				2076-3417										Tongji Univ, Coll Transportat Engn, Key Lab Rd & Traff Engn, Minist Educ, Shanghai 201804, Peoples R China				2023-08-03	WOS:001035000500001

In this study, a practicality-oriented learning-based EMS for a power-split hybrid electric bus (HEB) is presented, which combines the generative adversarial imitation learning (GAIL) and deep reinforcement learning (DRL). Considering the regular and fixed route of the HEB, optimal control samples that are not affected by the cost function can be obtained by the boundary-line dynamic programing (B-DP) method. On this basis, the samples are dynamically fitted using the GAIL method to inverse derive the reward function that can explain the B-DP control behavior. Concurrently, the proximal policy optimization DRL algorithm will regulate the energy distribution of the vehicle in real time and continuously optimize the energy management capability based on the reward feedback from GAIL. Finally, the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed EMS is verified by simulation. The results show that the proposed strategy exhibits near-optimal control performance under both the China heavy-duty commercial vehicle cycle-bus and China city bus cycle.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			0954-4070	2041-2991										Guangxi Univ, Coll Mech Engn, 100 East Daxue Rd, Nanning 530004, Peoples R ChinaGuangxi Yuchai Machinery Co Ltd, Yulin, Peoples R China	Guangxi Yuchai Machinery Co Ltd			2022-06-24	WOS:000810789800001

To avoid the grid overload that results from simultaneously charging too many electric vehicles, there is a need for smart charging coordination systems. In this paper, we propose a charging coordination system based on Reinforcement Learning using an artificial neural network as a function approximator. Taking into account the baseload present in the power grid, a central agent creates forward-looking, coordinated charging schedules for an electric vehicle fleet of any size. In contrast to optimization-based charging strategies, system dynamics such as future arrivals, departures, and energy consumption do not have to be known beforehand. We implement and compare a range of parameter variants that differ in terms of the reward function and prioritized experience. Subsequently, we use a case study to compare our Reinforcement Learning algorithm with several other charging strategies. The Reinforcement Learning-based charging coordination system is shown to perform very well. All electric vehicles have enough energy for their next trip on departure and charging is carried out almost exclusively during the load valleys at night. Compared with an uncontrolled charging strategy, the Reinforcement Learning algorithm reduces the variance of the total load by 65%. The performance of our Reinforcement Learning concept comes close to that of an optimization-based charging strategy. However, an optimization algorithm needs to know certain information beforehand, such as the vehicle's departure time and its energy requirement on arriving at the charging station. Our novel Reinforcement Learning-based charging coordination system therefore offers a flexible, easily adaptable, and scalable approach for an electric vehicle fleet under realistic operating conditions.									64	0	0	0	1	0	67			0306-2619	1872-9118										Friedrich Alexander Univ Erlangen Nurnberg, Comp Networks & Commun Syst Lab, Energy Informat, Erlangen, Germany				2021-05-23	WOS:000649545300008

The diversity gain is generally achieved by time-division multiplexing (TDM) during the transmission of frequency-modulated continuous-wave (FMCW) signals. However, TDM mode leads to longer pulse repetition intervals and, therefore, inherently and severely limits the maximum unambiguous Doppler velocity that a radar is able to detect. In this paper, we address the Doppler ambiguity problem in TDM MIMO automotive radars through a space-time adaptive processing (STAP) approach. A direct application of STAP may lead to a high antenna sidelobe level that hampers the detection performance. We mitigate this through optimal transmitter scheduling. We formulate the problem as combinatorial optimization and solve it via reinforcement learning. Numerical and experimental results demonstrate the efficacy of our method when compared with conventional techniques.					2020 IEEE Radar Conference (RadarConf20)2020 IEEE Radar Conference (RadarConf20)	21-25 Sept. 202021-25 Sept. 2020		Florence, ItalyFlorence, Italy	0	0	0	0	0	0	0					978-1-7281-8942-0									Hertzwell Pte Ltd., Singapore				2021-02-08	INSPEC:20255334

We formulate a contextual reinforcement learning problem to learn a human-like and stochastic policy with domain-informed choices for states, actions, and reward functions. To leverage very limited training data and build human-like diverse behavior, we fit a probabilistic model to the expert demonstrations called the reference distribution, draw samples out of it, and use them as context for the reinforcement learning agent with context-specific states and rewards. In contrast to the non-human-like stochasticity introduced by Gaussian noise, our method contributes to a more effective exploration, better performance and a policy with human-like variance in evaluation metrics. Compared to previous work using a behavioral cloning agent, which is unable to complete competitive laps robustly, our agent outperforms the professional driver used to collect the demonstrations by around 0.4 seconds per lap on average, which is the first time known to the authors that an autonomous agent has outperformed a top-class professional race driver in a state-of-the-art, high-fidelity simulation. Being robust and sensitive to vehicle setup changes, our agent is able to predict plausible lap time and other performance metrics. Furthermore, unlike traditional lap time calculation methods, our agent indicates not only the gain in performance but also the driveability when faced with modified car balance, facilitating the digital twin of the DiL simulation.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2377-3766											Dr Ingn HC F Porsche AG, D-71287 Weissach, GermanyTech Univ Darmstadt, Comp Sci Dept, Intelligent Autonomous Syst, D-64289 Darmstadt, Germany				2023-07-08	WOS:001004297800007

On one side, a common thread in ADAS applications is to focus entirely on the context of the vehicle and its surrounding vehicles leaving the human (driver) context out of consideration. On the other side, and due to the increasing sensing capabilities in mobile phones and wearable technologies, monitoring complex human context becomes feasible which paves the way to develop driver-in-the-loop context-aware ADAS that provide personalized driving experience. In this paper, we propose Sentio(1); a Reinforcement Learning based algorithm to enhance the Forward Collision Warning (FCW) system leading to Driver-in-the-Loop FCW system. Since the human driving preference is unknown a priori, varies between different drivers, and moreover, varies across time for the same driver, the proposed Sentio algorithm needs to take into account all these variabilities which are not handled by the standard reinforcement learning algorithms. We verified the proposed algorithm against several human drivers. Our evaluation, across distracted human drivers, shows a significant enhancement in driver experience-compared to standard FCW systems-reflected by an increase in the driver safety by 94.28%, an improvement in the driving experience by 20.97%, a decrease in the false negatives from 55.90% down to 3.26%, while adding less than 130 ms runtime execution overhead.					16th Conference on Embedded Networked Sensor Systems (SENSYS)16th Conference on Embedded Networked Sensor Systems (SENSYS)	NOV 04-07, 2018NOV 04-07, 2018	Assoc Comp Machinery; ACM SIGCOMM; ACM SIGMOBILE; ACM SIGARCH; ACM SIGBED; ACM SIGMETRICS; ACM SIGOPS; China Bldg New Mat Res Inst; Daxing United Space; HuaWei LiteOS; IoTeX; S Univ Sci & Technol China; Tsinghua Berkeley Shenzhen InstAssoc Comp Machinery; ACM SIGCOMM; ACM SIGMOBILE; ACM SIGARCH; ACM SIGBED; ACM SIGMETRICS; ACM SIGOPS; China Bldg New Mat Res Inst; Daxing United Space; HuaWei LiteOS; IoTeX; S Univ Sci & Technol China; Tsinghua Berkeley Shenzhen Inst	Shenzhen, PEOPLES R CHINAShenzhen, PEOPLES R CHINA	14	0	0	0	0	0	16					978-1-4503-5952-8									Univ Calif Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA				2019-06-14	WOS:000469016400003

Large amounts of sensor data require to be transferred in real-time. Most of the routing protocols are specifically targeted to specific situations in IoV. But communication environment of IoV usually changes in the space-time dimension. Unfortunately, the traditional vehicular networks cannot select the optimal routing policy when facing the dynamic environment, due to the lack of abilities of sensing the environment and learning the best strategy. Sensing and learning constitute two key steps of the cognition procedure. Thus, in this paper, we present a software defined cognitive network for IoV (SDCIV), in which reinforcement learning and software defined network technology are considered for IoV to achieve cognitive capability. To the best of our knowledge, this paper is the first one that can give the optimal routing policy adaptively through sensing and learning from the environment of IoV. We perform experiments on a real vehicular dataset to validate the effectiveness and feasibility of the proposed algorithm. Results show that our algorithm achieves better performance than several typical protocols in IoV. We also show the feasibility and effectiveness of our proposed SDCIV.									38	3	0	0	0	0	42			2327-4662											Tongji Univ, Dept Comp Sci & Engn, Key Lab Embedded Syst & Serv Comp, Minist Educ, Shanghai, Peoples R ChinaTongji Univ, Shanghai Elect Transact & Informat Serv, Collaborat Innovat Ctr, Shanghai, Peoples R ChinaDonghua Univ, Coll Informat Sci & Technol, Shanghai, Peoples R China				2018-11-30	WOS:000450251900028

Electric Vehicle Charging Management for Avoiding Transformer Congestion Using Policy-based Reinforcement Learning								2023 IEEE PES Innovative Smart Grid Technologies Europe (ISGT EUROPE)								1	5				10.1109/ISGTEUROPE56780.2023.10407357							Conference Paper	2023	2023	With the widespread integration of electric vehicles (EV) in distribution networks (DN), the distribution network operator faces new challenges relating to facility overloads such as distribution transformers. Due to similar charging behaviors of EV customers in residential areas, the peak loads caused by simultaneous charging processes will have a significant impact on the operation of DN. In this paper, the focus is on a cooperative approach among EVs with different individual preferences regarding charging demand urgency with the aim to jointly alleviate transformer congestion. An online algorithm using policy-based reinforcement learning is proposed, which takes the advantage of bidirectional charging infrastructures with continuous controllable charging rate for more flexible cooperation among EVs. A particular aim is to overcome the unscalability of neural networks due to the determined network structures before training processes. For this reason, a grouping method concerning individual charging behaviors is used for dimensionality reduction and scalable representation of the state and action space. Simulation results show that the proposed charging management is able to identify the preference of each EV group and to generate an appropriate charging rate with the purpose of minimizing the damage of EV charging satisfactions while avoiding overloading of transformers.					2023 IEEE PES Innovative Smart Grid Technologies Europe (ISGT EUROPE)2023 IEEE PES Innovative Smart Grid Technologies Europe (ISGT EUROPE)	20232023	IEEE PESIEEE PES	Grenoble, FranceGrenoble, France	0	0	0	0	0	0	0					979-8-3503-9678-2									Helmut Schmidt Univ., Hamburg, GermanyTheor. of Electr.

MARL based resource allocation scheme leveraging vehicular cloudlet in automotive-industry 5.0								JOURNAL OF KING SAUD UNIVERSITY-COMPUTER AND INFORMATION SCIENCES				35	6					101420			10.1016/j.jksuci.2022.10.011					JUN 2023		Article	JUN 2023	2023	Automotive-Industry 5.0 will use Beyond Fifth-Generation (B5G) communications to provide robust, abundant computation resources and energy-efficient data sharing among various Intelligent Transportation System (ITS) entities. Based on the vehicle communication network, the Internet of Vehicles (IoV) is created, where vehicles' resources, including processing, storage, sensing, and communication units, can be leveraged to construct Vehicular Cloudlet (VC) to realize resource sharing. As Connected and Autonomous Vehicles (CAV) onboard computing is becoming more potent, VC resources (comprising stationary and moving vehicles' idle resources) seems a promising solution to tackle the incessant computing requirements of vehicles. Furthermore, such spare computing resources can significantly reduce task requests' delay and transmission costs. In order to maximize the utility of task requests in the system under the maximum time constraint, this paper proposes a Secondary Resource Allocation (SRA) mechanism based on a dual time scale. The request service process is regarded as M/ M/1 queuing model and considers each task request in the same time slot as an agent. A Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP) is constructed and combined with the Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) algorithm known as QMix, which exploits the overall vehicle state and queue state to reach effective computing resource allocation decisions. There are two main performance metrics: the system's total utility and task completion rate. Simulation results reveal that the task completion rate is increased by 13%. Furthermore, compared with the deep deterministic policy optimization method, our proposed algorithm can improve the overall utility value by 70% and the task completion rate by 6%. & COPY; 2022 The Author(s).

Firstly, the kinematics segments are self-generated based on the Wasserstein generative adversarial network. The generator network G is used to generate kinematics segments. The discriminator network D is used to judge the credibility of the generated kinematics segments with the Wasserstein distance. The speed distribution characteristics of the training conditions and verification conditions established based on the self-generated segments are verified. Afterward, a multi-agent algorithm based on twin delayed deep deterministic policy gradient algorithm for hybrid systems is proposed by introducing centralized training with decentralized execution framework. The engine and a motor are used as two independent agents respectively. Different reward functions are designed based on training objectives to establish a mutually beneficial relationship of cooperation-restraint between the two agents. A driving mode constraint is designed in the environment to improve sample utilization. Finally, the simulation results demonstrate that our method can achieve better performance compared with other existing works.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0360-5442	1873-6785										Nanjing Univ Aeronaut & Astronaut, Jiangsu Engn Res Ctr Vehicle Distributed Drive & I, Nanjing 210016, Peoples R China				2023-09-04	WOS:001054632600001

It leverages Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG) algorithm to learn optimal process parameters update policies based on high dimensional state estimates of multi-station assembly systems (MAS). These policies can be interpreted in engineering terms as sequential corrective adjustments of process parameters that are necessary to mitigate RCs of product shape errors. The approach has the capability to estimate adjustments of process parameters related to fixturing and joining while simultaneously accounting for (i) RC uncertainty estimation, (ii) Key Performance Indicator (KPI) improvement, (iii) MAS design architecture; and, (iv) MAS inherent stochasticity. In addition, the OSEC methodology leverages a reward function parameterized by user interpretable functional coefficients for optimal tradeoff involving various corrections requirements. Benchmarking using an industrial, automotive cross-member assembly system demonstrates a 40% increase in the effectiveness of corrective actions when compared to current approaches.					2021 IEEE 19th International Conference on Industrial Informatics (INDIN)2021 IEEE 19th International Conference on Industrial Informatics (INDIN)	21-23 July 202121-23 July 2021	IEEE; IEEE IESIEEE; IEEE IES	Palma de Mallorca, SpainPalma de Mallorca, Spain	0	0	0	0	0	0	0					978-1-7281-4395-8									Digital Lifecycle Manage., Univ. of Warwick, Coventry, UK				2022-04-20	INSPEC:21229555

First, we model the SCASSs by Newtonian dynamics as well as considering the uncertainties and nonlinear dynamics of the actuator. Second, in order to solve the complexity brought by uncertainties, we apply the Takagi-Sugeno (T-S) fuzzy approach to transform the SCASSs as multilinear systems, as well as solving the optimal control problem as a zero-sum problem to find the solution of Nash-equilibrium. Third, we construct a novel self-learning method based on the reinforcement learning framework, and propose two algorithms to solve the fuzzy game algebraic Riccati equation. Especially, in the second algorithm, without using any model information of the SCASSs, we only use the state and input information in control design by a self-learning manner removing the traditional dependence problem, which is more preferable for practical applications. Finally, we give a simulation result of the SCASSs to demonstrate the effectiveness and practicability for the designed self-learning algorithms.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			1941-0034											Sch. of Electr.

The former is required for sensing and perception, more frequently so under various unfavorable environmental conditions such as heavy precipitation; the latter is needed to transmit time-critical data. Forthcoming proliferation of faster 5G networks utilizing mmWave is likely to lead to interference with automotive radar sensors, which has led to a body of research on the development of Joint Radar Communication (JRC) systems and solutions. This paper considers the problem of time-sharing for JRC, with the additional simultaneous objective of minimizing the average age of information (AoI) transmitted by a JRC-equipped AV. We formulate the problem as a Markov Decision Process (MDP) where the JRC agent determines in a real-time manner when radar detection is necessary, and how to manage a multiclass data queue where each class represents different urgency levels of data packets. Simulations are run with a range of environmental parameters to mimic variations in real-world operation. The results show that deep reinforcement learning allows the agent to obtain good results with minimal a priori knowledge about the environment.					2021 IEEE Intelligent Vehicles Symposium (IV)2021 IEEE Intelligent Vehicles Symposium (IV)	11-15 July 202111-15 July 2021	Toyota; TierIV; Denso; AISIN Corp.; J-Quad; sensetime; IDTechEx; Qualcomm; Toshiba; SonyToyota; TierIV; Denso; AISIN Corp.; J-Quad; sensetime; IDTechEx; Qualcomm; Toshiba; Sony	Nagoya, JapanNagoya, Japan	2	0	0	0	0	0	2					978-1-7281-5394-0									Energy Res.

Using an automatic driving system as an agent to assist or replace human drivers is considered an effective way to fundamentally solve the threats caused by human factors. First, to maximize the overall safety of intelligent vehicles, a human-vehicle risk game model was established by utilizing entropy- technique for order preference by similarity to ideal solution (TOPSIS) and complete static game theory. A strategy function to maximize the relative utility was proposed and embedded in the reinforcement learning reward function, then the reward and punishment mechanism guided by maximizing vehicle safety expectation were deduced. Second, taking advantage of reinforcement learning which is good at solving sequence decision-making problems, a human-vehicle driving control transition method based on advantage actor critical (A2C) was proposed. The output effect of the decision model was optimized by iterating the decision weights and reward functions, and the validity of the training process and result was verified by the model performance evaluation indices. Finally, the influence of different transition times on vehicle safety was analyzed through simulation test. A control right decision-making method that can limit risky behaviors and improve vehicle safety timely and effectively was proposed. The results showed that this research innovatively takes the actor and critic modules mapped from the human and vehicle risk monitoring module to A2C as the framework, which fully utilizes the interaction between intelligent vehicle and human-vehicle risk state. Moreover, it achieves the maximum return by obtaining rewards updated iteratively. The decision-making method of human-machine driving control right guided by promoting the maximization of vehicle safety is realized.			频发的交通事故证明驾驶车辆是一类高风险行为,驾驶人的风险驾驶行为是引发交通事故的主要诱因,自动驾驶系统辅助或代替人类驾驶人被视为从根本上解决人为因素导致行车风险的有效途径。首先,以智能汽车的整体安全性最大化为目标,使用熵权-逼近理想解排序法(Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution, TOPSIS)和完全静态博弈理论建立了人、车风险博弈模型,提出了相对效用最大化的策略函数并嵌入强化学习奖励函数中,推理了以最大化车辆安全性期望为导向的强化学习奖惩机制。其次,利用强化学习算法擅长解决序列决策问题的优势,提出了基于优势演员评论家(Advantage Actor Critic, A2C)的人机共驾控制权决策方法,通过迭代人、车风险决策权重和奖励函数优化了决策模型的输出效果,借助模型性能评价指标进行了训练过程和结果的有效性验证。最后,通过仿真试验分析了不同切换时机对车辆安全性的影响,提出了能够及时有效地限制驾驶人风险行为并提升车辆安全性的控制权决策方法。研究结果表明:研究创新地以人、车风险监测模块分别映射至A2C的演员、评论家模块为研究框架,充分发挥了智能汽车与人、车风险状态进行交互并通过获取奖励来迭代更新取得最大回报的效果,实现了以促进车辆安全性最大化为导向的人机共驾控制权决策方法。						1	1	0	0	0	0	2			1001-7372											燕山大学车辆与能源学院, 秦皇岛, 河北 066004, 中国School of Vehicle and Energy, Yanshan University, Qinhuangdao, Hebei 066004, China	燕山大学车辆与能源学院School of Vehicle and Energy, Yanshan University			2022-07-15	CSCD:7208611

The Modular Multilevel Series Parallel Converters topology offers great advantages in automotive applications such as higher efficiency compared to conventional converters and active balancing of the State of Charge. Furthermore the internal resistance and the current ripple of the batteries can be reduced by parallel interconnections. For ideal control, all of these parameters have to be weighted according to their significance, which changes during operation of the MMSPC. Due to multiple degrees of freedom which are mostly non-linear, it is challenging to find the optimal switching strategy in conventional ways. We present a novel approach which uses not only a Neural Network, but also reinforcement learning to optimize the control strategy in a simulative setup.

Fuel-cell vehicles with advantages of zero emission,high efficiency,diversification of fuel sources,and renewable energy have been the focus of international automotive giants and Chinese automotive enterprises. Establishing a reasonable energy management strategy,effectively controlling the vehicle working mode,and reasonably using battery energy for hybrid fuel-cell vehicles are core technologies in domestic and foreign automobile enterprises and research institutes. To improve the equilibrium between fuel-cell hydrogen consumption and battery consumption and realize the optimal energy distribution between fuel-cell systems and batteries for plug-in fuel-cell electric vehicles (PFCEVs),considering vehicles as the environment and vehicle control as an agent,an energy management strategy for the PFCEV based on reinforcement learning algorithm was proposed in this paper. This strategy considered the immediate return and future cumulative discounted returns of a fuel-cell vehicles real-time energy allocation. The vehicle simulation model was built by Matlab /Simulink to carry out the simulation test for the proposed strategy.

The Modular Multilevel Series Parallel Converters topology offers great advantages in automotive applications such as higher efficiency compared to conventional converters and active balancing of the State of Charge. Furthermore the internal resistance and the current ripple of the batteries can be reduced by parallel interconnections. For ideal control, all of these parameters have to be weighted according to their significance, which changes during operation of the MMSPC. Due to multiple degrees of freedom which are mostly non-linear, it is challenging to find the optimal switching strategy in conventional ways. We present a novel approach which uses not only a Neural Network, but also reinforcement learning to optimize the control strategy in a simulative setup. Compared to conventional optimization methods a faster computation time can be achieved component tolerances and ageing processes can be taken into account.					21st European Conference on Power Electronics and Applications (EPE ECCE Europe)21st European Conference on Power Electronics and Applications (EPE ECCE Europe)	SEP 03-05, 2019SEP 03-05, 2019		Genova, ITALYGenova, ITALY	0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2325-0313		978-9-0758-1531-3									Karlsruhe Inst Technol, Kaiserstr 12, Karlsruhe, Germany				2020-03-12	WOS:000515073403039

Pricing Strategy of Fast Charging Stations in Coupled Power-Transportation System Considering Responsive Traffic Demand								The 37th Annual Conference on Power System and Automation in Chinese Universities (CUS-EPSA). Lecture Notes in Electrical Engineering (1030)								460	9				10.1007/978-981-99-1439-5_43							Conference Paper	2023	2023	The price of fast charging stations (FCSs) can dramatically impact the behavior of electric vehicle (EV) users on choosing paths or charging stations, which will further influence the operation of both power distribution network (PDN) and transportation network (TN). This paper proposes a unique framework to get an optimal pricing strategy for FCSs considering the responsive traffic demand of EV users. The responsive traffic demand correlates closely with the current charging price and traffic condition. The optimal pricing problem of FCSs considered coupled operation of PDN and TN is first formulated as a bi-level optimization model to maximize the profit of the distribution power system operator (DSO). Then a deep reinforcement learning method is adopted to approximately solve the hard bi-level problem. Numerical experiments demonstrate that the proposed strategy can redistribute charging loads and enhance the operation of PDN.

A Neural Approach Towards Real-time Management for Integrated Energy System Incorporating Carbon Trading and Electrical Vehicle Scheduling								International Conference on Neural Computing for Advanced Applications: 4th International Conference, NCAA 2023, Proceedings. Communications in Computer and Information Science (1870)								561	75				10.1007/978-981-99-5847-4_40							Conference Paper	2023	2023	This paper proposes a real-time integrated energy system (IES) management approach which aims at promoting overall energy efficiency, increasing renewable energy penetration, and smoothing load fluctuation. The electric vehicles (EVs) charging scheduling is incorporated into the IES management, where the uncertain arrivals and departures of multiple EVs are considered as a stochastic but flexible load to the IES. Furthermore, towards the carbon neutralization target, a carbon emissions trading mechanism is introduced into the IES management to incentivize the system to operate in an eco-friendlier manner. To tackle the computational complexity induced by the stochastic and intermittent nature of the renewable energy sources and EVs load, the scheduling of the IES is realized in a neural network based real-time manner, driven by a deep reinforcement learning approach that guarantees safe training and operation. The case study verifies the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

The model comprises (i) two new antecedents of GSCMP: relationship learning capability (RL) and strategic networking orientation (NO), and (ii) the direct and mediated impacts of GSCMP and their antecedents on firms' GI. To empirically study the proposed relationships, data were collected from 106 Spanish firms in the automotive industry and analyzed using partial least squares structural equation modelling (PLS-SEM). The results indicate that NO, RL capability, and GSCMP positively affect GI through a sequential mediation relationship. An important implication is the identification of a stream of research proposing that GSCMP act similarly to a lower-order capability and that it is the interaction with other ordinary capabilities that can contribute to improving the green image.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			0040-1625	1873-5509										Univ Seville, Seville, Spain				2023-05-28	WOS:000984576600001

However, there are associated uncertainties which present new challenges to HEMSs, such as aleatory EV arrival and departure times, unknown EV battery states of charge at the connection time, and stochastic PV production due to weather and passing cloud conditions. The proposed HEMS is based on proximal policy optimization (PPO), which is a deep reinforcement learning algorithm suitable for continuous complex environments. The optimal solution for HEMS is a tradeoff between CAEV driver's range anxiety, batteries degradation, and energy consumption, which is solved by means of incentives/penalties in the reinforcement learning formulation. The proposed PPO algorithm was compared to conventional methods such as business-as-usual (BAU) and value iteration (VI) solutions based on dynamic programming. Simulation results indicate that the proposed PPO's performance showed a daily energy cost reduction of 54% and 27% compared to BAU and VI, respectively. Finally, the developed PPO algorithm is suitable for real-time operations due to its fast execution and good convergence to the optimal solution.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0				1996-1073										Univ Carlos III Madrid, Dept Elect Engn, Leganes 28911, Spain				2023-08-19	WOS:001045326200001

In order to model the operations of a commercial EV fleet, we utilize the EV routing problem with time windows (EVRPTW). In this research, we propose an end-to-end deep reinforcement learning framework to solve the EVRPTW. In particular, we develop an attention model incorporating the pointer network and a graph embedding technique to parameterize a stochastic policy for solving the EVRPTW. The model is then trained using policy gradient with rollout baseline. Our numerical studies show that the proposed model is able to efficiently solve EVRPTW instances of large sizes that are not solvable with any existing approaches.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0														Dept. of Mech. & Ind.

Considering the interaction characteristics of ADNs with distributed energy resources (DERs), the scheduling objective is constructed to reduce the operation cost and optimize the voltage distribution. To tackle this problem, a LSTM module is employed to perform feature extraction on the ADN environment, which can realize the recognition and learning of massive temporal structure data. The concerned ADN real-time scheduling model is duly formulated as a finite Markov decision process (FMDP). Moreover, a modified deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG) algorithm is proposed to solve the complex decision-making problem. Numerous experimental results within a modified IEEE 33-bus system demonstrate the validity and superiority of the proposed method.

Consequently, automatic charging and discharging scheduling responding to electricity prices that change over time is required to reduce the charging cost of EVs, while increasing the grid reliability by moving charging loads from on-peak to off-peak periods. Hence, this study proposes a deep reinforcement learning-based, real-time EV charging and discharging algorithm. The proposed method utilizes kernel density estimation, particularly the nonparametric density function estimation method, to model the usage pattern of a specific charger at a specific location. Subsequently, the estimated density function is used to sample variables related to charger usage pattern so that the variables can be cast in the training process of a reinforcement learning agent. This ensures that the agent optimally learns the characteristics of the target charger. We analyzed the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm from two perspectives, i.e., charging cost and load shifting effect. Simulation results show that the proposed method outperforms the benchmarks that simply model usage pattern through general assumptions in terms of charging cost and load shifting effect. This means that when a reinforcement learning-based charging/discharging algorithm is deployed in a specific location, it is better to use data-driven approach to reflect the characteristics of the location, so that the charging cost reduction and the effect of load flattening are obtained.									26	1	0	0	0	0	27				1996-1073										Gwangju Inst Sci & Technol, Sch Integrated Technol, 123 Cheomdangwagi Ro, Gwangju 61005, South Korea				2020-07-14	WOS:000538041800093

In this paper, we present a practical, data-driven, and human-centric EV charging recommendation system at the city-scale based on deep reinforcement learning (DRL). The system co-optimizes the welfare of both the EV drivers and the grid. We augmented and aggregated data from various sources, including public data, location-based data companies, and government authorities, with different formats and time granularities. The data includes EV charger information, grid capacity, EV driving behavior information, and city-scale mobility. We created a 30-day per-minute unified EV charger information dataset with charging prices and grid capacity, as well as an EV driving behavior dataset with location and State of Charge (SoC) information. Our evaluation of the recommendation system shows that it is able to provide recommendations that reduce the average driver-to-charger distance and minimize the number of times chargers switch to a different driver.

Deep Reinforcement Learning framework for Autonomous Driving [arXiv]								arXiv								7 pp.	7 pp.											Journal Paper	8 April 2017	2017	Reinforcement learning is considered to be a strong AI paradigm which can be used to teach machines through interaction with the environment and learning from their mistakes. Despite its perceived utility, it has not yet been successfully applied in automotive applications. Motivated by the successful demonstrations of learning of Atari games and Go by Google DeepMind, we propose a framework for autonomous driving using deep reinforcement learning. This is of particular relevance as it is difficult to pose autonomous driving as a supervised learning problem due to strong interactions with the environment including other vehicles, pedestrians and roadworks. As it is a relatively new area of research for autonomous driving, we provide a short overview of deep reinforcement learning and then describe our proposed framework. It incorporates Recurrent Neural Networks for information integration, enabling the car to handle partially observable scenarios. It also integrates the recent work on attention models to focus on relevant information, thereby reducing the computational complexity for deployment on embedded hardware. The framework was tested in an open source 3D car racing simulator called TORCS. Our simulation results demonstrate learning of autonomous maneuvering in a scenario of complex road curvatures and simple interaction of other vehicles.

Dynamic Unicast-Multicast Scheduling for Age-Optimal Information Dissemination in Vehicular Networks								2022 IEEE Globecom Workshops (GC Wkshps)								1218	23				10.1109/GCWkshps56602.2022.10008649							Conference Paper	2022	2022	This paper investigates the problem of minimizing the age-of-information (AoI) and transmit power consumption in a vehicular network, where a roadside unit (RSU) provides timely updates about a set of physical processes to vehicles. Each vehicle is interested in maintaining the freshness of its information status about one or more physical processes. A framework is proposed to optimize the decisions to unicast, multicast, broadcast, or not transmit updates to vehicles as well as power allocations to minimize the AoI and the RSU's power consumption over a time horizon. The formulated problem is a mixed-integer nonlinear programming problem (MINLP), thus a global optimal solution is difficult to achieve. In this context, we first develop an ant colony optimization (ACO) solution which provides near-optimal performance and thus serves as an efficient benchmark. Then, for real-time implementation, we develop a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) framework that captures the vehicles' demands and channel conditions in the state space and assigns processes to vehicles through dynamic unicast-multicast scheduling actions. Complexity analysis of the proposed algorithms is presented. Simulation results depict interesting trade-offs between AoI and power consumption as a function of the network parameters.					2022 IEEE Globecom Workshops (GC Wkshps)2022 IEEE Globecom Workshops (GC Wkshps)	4-8 Dec. 20224-8 Dec. 2022		Rio de Janeiro, BrazilRio de Janeiro, Brazil	0	0	0	0	0	0	0					978-1-6654-5975-4									Dept. of Electr.

This paper integrates various machine learning algorithms, which are applied to the failure prediction and warning of various types of vehicles, such as the vehicle transmission system, abnormal engine operation, and tire condition prediction. This paper first discusses the three main AI algorithms, such as supervised learning, unsupervised learning, and reinforcement learning, and compares the advantages and disadvantages of each algorithm in the application of system prediction. In the second part, we summarize which artificial intelligence algorithm architectures are suitable for each system failure condition. According to the fault status of different vehicles, it is necessary to carry out the evaluation of the digital filtering process. At the same time, it is necessary to preconstruct its model analysis and adjust the parameter attributes, types, and number of samples of various vehicle prediction models according to the analysis results, followed by optimization to obtain various vehicle models. Finally, through a cross-comparison and sorting, the artificial intelligence failure prediction models can be obtained, which can correspond to the failure status of a certain car model and a certain system, thereby realizing a most appropriate AI model for a specific application.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1				2072-666X										Chang Gung Univ, Coll Engn, Sch Elect & Comp Engn, Dept Elect Engn, Taoyuan 33302, TaiwanChang Gung Univ, Coll Engn, Green Technol Res Ctr, Portable Energy Syst Grp, Taoyuan 33302, TaiwanChang Gung Mem Hosp, Dept Neurosurg, Taoyuan 33302, Taiwan				2022-09-29	WOS:000856957200001	36144003

The ability of blending the torque during gear shifts from one clutch to the other, making the type of automated transmission a perfect alternative to torque converters, which also comes with a higher efficiency. Nevertheless, DCT also have some drawbacks. The actuation of two clutches requires an immense control effort, which is handled in the implementation of a wide range of software functions on the transmission control unit (TCU). These usually contain control parameters, which makes the behavior adaptable to different vehicle and engine platforms. The adaption of these parameters is called calibration, which is usually an iterative time-consuming process. The calibration of the embedded software solutions in control units is a widely known problem in the automotive industry. The calibration of any vehicle subsystem (e.g., engine, transmission, suspension, driver assistance systems for autonomous driving, etc.) requires costly test trips in different ambient conditions. To reduce the calibration effort and the accompanying use of professionals, several approaches to automize the calibration process are proposed. Due to the fact that a solution is desired which can optimize different calibration problems, a generic metaheuristic approach is aimed. Regardless, the scope of the current research is the optimization of the launch behavior for vehicles equipped with DCT since, particularly at low speeds, the transmission behavior must meet the intention of the driver (drivers tend to be more perceptive at low speeds). To clarify the characteristics of the launch, several test subject studies are performed. The influence factors, such as engine sound, maximal acceleration, acceleration build-up (mean jerk), and the reaction time, are taken into account. Their influence on the evaluation of launch with relation to the criteria of sportiness, comfort, and jerkiness, are examined based on the evaluation of the test subject studies. According to the results of the study, reference values for the optimization of the launch behavior are derived. The research contains a study of existing approaches for optimizing driving behavior with metaheuristics (e.g., genetic algorithms, reinforcement learning, etc.). Since the existing approaches have different drawbacks (in scope of the optimization problem) a new approach is proposed, which outperforms existing ones. The approach itself is a hybrid solution of reinforcement learning (RL) and supervised learning (SL) and is applied in a software in the loop environment, and in a test vehicle.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3				2076-3417										Magna PT BV & Co KG, Hermann Hagenmeyer Str 1, D-74199 Untergruppenbach, GermanyTech Univ Darmstadt, Inst Mechatron Syst, Otto Berndt Str 2, D-64287 Darmstadt, Germany	Magna PT BV & Co KG			2022-11-02	WOS:000872187500001

A basic requirement of any vehicle participating in dynamic collaborative driving is longitudinal control. Without this capability, higher-level coordination is not possible. Each vehicle involved is a composite non-linear system powered by an internal combustion engine, equipped with automatic transmission, rolling on rubber tyres with a hydraulic braking system. This paper focuses on the problem of longitudinal motion control. A longitudinal vehicle model is introduced which serves as the control system design platform. A longitudinal adaptive control system that uses Monte Carlo reinforcement learning (RL) is introduced. The results of the RL phase and the performance of the adaptive control system for a single automobile, as well as the performance in a multi-vehicle platoon, are presented.									8	0	0	0	0	0	10			1471-0242											Dept. of Mech. & Mechatron.

Currently, learning based algorithms have been widely applied in energy controlling performance of HEVs. However, the enormous computation intensity, massive data training and rigid requirement of prediction of future operation state hinder their substantial exploitation. To mitigate these concerns, an imitation reinforcement learning-based algorithm with optimal guidance is proposed in this paper for energy control of hybrid vehicles to accelerate the solving process and meanwhile achieve preferable control performance. Firstly, offline global optimization is firstly conducted considering various driving conditions to search power allocation trajectories. Then, the battery depletion boundaries with respect to driving distance are introduced to generate a narrowed state space, in which the optimal trajectory is fused into the training process of reinforcement learning to guide the high-efficiency strategy production. The simulation validations reveal that the proposed method provides preferable energy reduction for HEVs in arbitrary driving scenarios, and suggests an efficient solution instruction for similar problems in mechanical and electrical systems with constraints and optimal information.									12	0	0	0	0	0	12			0360-5442	1873-6785										Chongqing Univ, State Key Lab Mech Transmiss, Chongqing 400000, Peoples R ChinaTsinghua Univ, State Key Lab Automot Safety & Energy, Beijing 100084, Beijing, Peoples R ChinaLoughborough Univ, Dept Aeronaut & Automot Engn, Loughborough LE11 3TU, EnglandKunming Univ Sci & Technol, Fac Transportat Engn, Kunming 650500, Peoples R China				2022-11-24	WOS:000882432000001

This paper exploits the increasing diffusion of EVs to realize a crowdsourcing platform called e-Uber that jointly enables ride-sharing and energy-sharing through V2G and BST. We employ theoretical concepts of online spatial crowdsourcing, reinforcement learning, and reverse auction to devise this novel platform.

However, inspection of transmission lines in an unoccupied area is time-consuming and labor-intensive. Recently, unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) inspection has attracted remarkable attention in the space-ground collaborative smart grid, where UAVs are able to provide full converge of patrol points on transmission lines without the limitation of communication and manpower. Nevertheless, how to schedule UAVs to traverse numerous, dispersed target nodes in a vast area with the least cost (e.g., time consumption and total distance) has rarely been studied. In this paper, we focus on this challenging and practical issue which can be considered as a family of vehicle routing problems (VRPs) with regard to different constraints, and propose a Diverse Trajectory-driven Deep Reinforcement Learning (DT-DRL) approach with encoder-decoder scheme to tackle it. First, we bring in a threshold unit in our encoder for better state representation. Secondly, we realize that the already visited nodes have no impact on future decisions, and then devise a dynamic-aware context embedding which removes irrelevant nodes to trace the current graph. Finally, we introduce multiply decoders with identical structure but unshared parameters, and design a Kullback-Leibler divergence based regular term to enforce decoders to output diverse trajectories, which expands the search space and enhances the routing performance. Comprehensive experiments on five types of routing problems show that our approach consistently outperforms both DRL and heuristic methods by a clear margin.

These policies can be interpreted in engineering terms as sequential corrective adjustments of process parameters that are necessary to mitigate RCs of product shape errors. The approach has the capability to estimate adjustments of process parameters related to fixturing and joining while simultaneously accounting for (i) RC uncertainty estimation, (ii) Key Performance Indicator (KPI) improvement, (iii) MAS design architecture; and, (iv) MAS inherent stochasticity. In addition, the OSEC methodology leverages a reward function parameterized by user interpretable functional coefficients for optimal tradeoff involving various corrections requirements.

Since there usually exists a mismatch between the training and test/true environments, incorporating model uncertainty into system design is of critical importance in real-world applications. However, model uncertainties have not been considered explicitly in EV AMoD system rebalancing by existing literature yet, and the coexistence of model uncertainties and constraints that the decision should satisfy makes the problem even more challenging. In this work, we design a robust and constrained multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) framework with state transition kernel uncertainty for EV AMoD systems. We then propose a robust and constrained MARL algorithm (ROCOMA) with robust natural policy gradients (RNPG) that trains a robust EV rebalancing policy to balance the supply-demand ratio and the charging utilization rate across the city under model uncertainty. Experiments show that the ROCOMA can learn an effective and robust rebalancing policy. It outperforms non-robust MARL methods in the presence of model uncertainties. It increases the system fairness by 19.6% and decreases the rebalancing costs by 75.8%.					2023 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS)2023 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS)	20232023		Detroit, MI, USADetroit, MI, USA	0	0	0	0	0	0	0					978-1-6654-9190-7									Dept. of Comput.

It is well known that the traditional backstepping control scheme is suitable to solve higher order nonlinear system based on the strict-feedback form; however, the disadvantage of the procedure requires computing the derivatives of virtual control signals, which is a very complex task. Therefore, a reinforcement learning scheme using the deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG) control strategy is developed to replace the process of finding virtual control force in backstepping method. It not only avoids the complexity of analytically calculating the derivatives of the virtual control signals, but also retains the systems robustness when there exist random disturbances from road irregularities. To verify the performance of the proposed active suspension control scheme, the random road unevenness profiles according to ISO 8608 is considered as vertical and lateral disturbance input excitation of a full-vehicle suspension system. Compared with conventional passive suspension system and backstepping control scheme, the proposed approach can be demonstrated to not only effectively improve ride comfort under random road excitation, but also improve the transient response and robustness.									4	0	0	0	0	0	5			1751-8644	1751-8652										Feng Chia Univ, Dept Automat Control Engn, Taichung 40724, TaiwanFeng Chia Univ, PhD Program Elect & Commun Engn, Taichung, TaiwanAutomot Res & Testing Ctr, Elect Control & Informat Commun Technol Team, Res & Dev Div, Changhua, Taiwan	Automot Res & Testing Ctr			2022-07-03	WOS:000816929700001

The simulation results show how the agent can obtain good results on standard cycles, such as WLTP, UDDS and AUDC, and on real-world driving cycles. Moreover, it displays great adaptability to driving cycles different from the training one.

ADAS involves several technologies such as automotive electronics, vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) communication, RADAR, LIDAR, computer vision, and machine learning. Of these, computer vision and machine learning based solutions have mainly been effective that have allowed real-time vehicle control, driver aided systems, etc. However, most of the existing works deal with the deployment of ADAS and autonomous driving functionality in countries with well-disciplined lane traffic. Nevertheless, these solutions and frameworks do not work in countries and cities with less-disciplined/chaotic traffic. This paper identifies the research gaps, reviews the state-of-the-art looking at the different functionalities of ADAS and its levels of autonomy. Importantly, it provides a detailed description of vision intelligence and computational intelligence for ADAS. The eye-gaze and head pose estimation in vision intelligence is detailed. Notably, the learning algorithms such as supervised, unsupervised, reinforcement learning and deep learning solutions for ADAS are considered and discussed. Significantly, this would enable developing a real-time recommendation system for system-assisted/autonomous vehicular environments with less-disciplined road traffic.									26	0	0	0	0	0	27			2379-8858	2379-8904										Indian Inst Informat Technol, Smart Transportat Res Grp, Sri City 517646, Andhra Pradesh, IndiaIndiana Univ Purdue Univ Indianapolis IUPUI, Indianapolis, IN 46202 USADuale Hsch Baden Wurttemberg DHBW, D-70174 Heidenheim, Germany	Indian Inst Informat TechnolDuale Hsch Baden Wurttemberg DHBW			2022-08-23	WOS:000838544400019

Decentralized Multiagent Reinforcement Learning-based Cooperative Perception with Dual-functional Radar-Communication V2V Links								2023 IEEE International Conference on Communications Workshops (ICC Workshops)								1100	5				10.1109/ICCWorkshops57953.2023.10283653							Conference Paper	2023	2023	The ever-increasing deployment of connected automated vehicles (CAVs) equipped with multiple radar transceivers increases the demand for both efficient environment sensing and reliable data sharing for safe driving. However, two challenges are observed for cooperative perception used in automotive scenarios, i.e., performance tradeoff between sensing and communication, as well as effective resource scheduling in the dynamic environment. In this paper, a fully decentralized multiagent reinforcement framework is developed to optimize cooperative perception based on integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) technology. We first formulate the beamforming and power allocation problem as a Markov decision process (MDP). Then we design a beacon signal to implement data broadcast and reformulate the problem as a more general multiagent partially observed Markov decision process (POMDP). In this case, the dual-functional radar- communication (DFRC) waveform can implement sensing and vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) data exchange simultaneously without central nodes, mitigating interference and avoiding an extra communication resource demand. Numerical results show that our method is effective for real-time perception. It fairly provides identical quality of service (QoS) to all CAVs and achieves a low age of information (AoI) with minimal prior knowledge about the environment.					2023 IEEE International Conference on Communications Workshops (ICC Workshops)2023 IEEE International Conference on Communications Workshops (ICC Workshops)	20232023		Rome, ItalyRome, Italy	0	0	0	0	0	0	0					979-8-3503-3307-7									Nat.

A car-following control strategy based on self-learning and a supervised-learning hybrid-driven framework was proposed for human-like high-performance car-following control. First, the car-following data were collected through a real vehicle-testing platform. The car-following control problem was modeled as a Markov decision process, and a self-learning car-following control strategy was established by using the deep deterministic policy gradient, which is a deep reinforcement-learning method, long short-term memory was adopted to model the state transition of the Markov decision process and predict future states according to historical data, and a car-following reference model with human-driver characteristics was established based on Gaussian mixture regression combined with a hidden Markov model and introduced into the reinforcement-learning architecture. A self-learning and supervised-learning hybrid-driven architecture was proposed. The introduction of the human-driver car-following reference model can guide the reinforcement learning to learn the characteristics of a human driver correctly, the personification of the strategy is improved, and the Marko-decision-process state-transition model enables the strategy to consider the state randomness of the car-following process when acceleration decisions are made. Finally, we used real car-following data to verify the strategy, compared the car-following control performance of the proposed strategy and that of the supervised learning strategy, and a series of quantitative evaluation indexes were provided. The results demonstrate that the proposed strategy outperforms human drivers in tracking front-vehicle speed and maintaining the ideal following distance, effectively reduces the acceleration shock in the process of car following, achieves satisfactory personification, and ensures safety, tracking, and comfort in car-following.			随着人工智能技术的不断进步,越来越多的数据驱动方法被用于解决智能汽车跟驰控制问题,基于此,提出一种自学习和监督学习混合驱动的跟驰控制策略,实现拟人化的高性能跟驰控制。首先,基于实车试验平台采集跟驰数据,将跟驰控制问题建模为马尔可夫决策过程,利用深度强化学习中的深度确定性策略梯度建立自学习跟驰控制策略,基于长短期记忆网络对马尔可夫决策过程的状态转移进行建模,根据历史数据对未来状态进行预测,利用高斯混合回归和连续隐式马尔可夫模型建立具有人类驾驶人特性的跟驰参考模型并将其引入强化学习架构中。提出一种自学习和监督学习的混合架构,通过引入人类驾驶人跟驰参考模型引导强化学习正确学习人类驾驶人特性,提升策略拟人性;通过对马尔可夫决策过程状态转移建模使策略进行加速度决策时能够考虑跟驰过程的状态随机性。最后利用实车跟驰数据进行策略验证,对提出策略和监督学习策略的跟驰控制性能进行对比并给出一系列量化评价指标。研究结果表明:所提出策略在跟踪前车速度和保持理想跟驰距离上具有超越人类驾驶人的表现,并有效降低了跟驰过程中的加速度冲击,在保证跟驰安全性、跟踪性、舒适性的同时具备较好的拟人性。						0	1	0	0	0	0	1			1001-7372											吉林大学, 汽车仿真与控制国家重点实验室, 长春, 吉林 130025, 中国中国第一汽车集团有限公司智能网联开发院, 长春, 吉林 130011, 中国Jilin University, State Key Laboratory of Automotive Simulation and Control, Changchun, Jilin 130025, ChinaIntelligent Connected Vehicle Development Institute of China FAW Group Co.

The need for intelligent fueling without human assistance stimulates the development of wireless charging. There are, however, several issues to be addressed to enhance the efficiency and reliability of charging. The vehicle battery exhibits varying resistance during the charging process. Additionally, the alignment and gap may change with external positioning, which affects the coupling coefficient of the transmitter and receiver coils. Thus, a data-driven control scheme is desired to tackle these environmental uncertainties. This paper adopts the control scheme of embedding a Buck converter at the receiver side. Different from state-of-the-art literature, a reinforcement learning-based data-driven control approach is employed to regulate the charging voltage. Stable charging voltage is attained regardless of the knowledge of the coupling coefficient, load variations, or component values. System simulations in Simulink have proved the effectiveness of the proposed control method.					12th Annual IEEE Energy Conversion Congress and Exposition (IEEE ECCE)12th Annual IEEE Energy Conversion Congress and Exposition (IEEE ECCE)	SEP 23-OCT 15, 2020SEP 23-OCT 15, 2020	IEEE; IEEE Ind Applicat Soc; IEEE Power Elect Soc; MathWorks; ROHM SemiconductorIEEE; IEEE Ind Applicat Soc; IEEE Power Elect Soc; MathWorks; ROHM Semiconductor	Detroit, MIDetroit, MI	0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2329-3721		978-1-7281-5826-6									NYU, Dept Elect & Comp Engn, Brooklyn, NY 11201 USAToshiba Int Corp, Res & Dev Dept, Houston, TX USA				2021-05-26	WOS:000645593603087		
J											An AI system for automated profiling of driving patterns																												Awarded Grant	Sep 23 2018	2018	In this project PhD project, in collaboration with a dynamic start-up, Evezy, we will develop an AI system for the automated profiling of driving patterns using historical measurements generated by a large fleet of vehicles and the detection of risky behaviour in real-time. This aligns in particular with EPSRC research aims for artificial intelligence technologies, complexity science, and infrastructure and urban systems.Vehicle fleet management businesses rely on safe drivers to support their operations. Safe drivers are preferable as they have a direct economic and financial impact on the fleet operator's business. Aggressive driving increases fuel consumption, cost of vehicle maintenance, risk of accidents, cost of insurance, and risk of poor customer experience (e.g. for taxi related operations). This work aims to assess sensor information for risk identification, in a manner that is not only accurate but has an explanatory process or assessment criteria. While something like a deep neural networks may be necessary to process and classify characteristics from a raw image data-set, the implications of the identified characteristics can be described by a myriad of plausible Reinforcement Learning techniques. Potential impacts or applications include utilising images captured by sensors on automotive vehicles to identify, classify and react to possible threats to driver and pedestrian safety.The system will implement a metric score reflecting the degree of risk that a driver exhibits at any given time based on a combination of historical as well as current driving data. The AI system will leverage a large volume of historical data collected by Evezy customers characterising how the vehicles are being operated and in what driving conditions, at a temporal resolution of approximately 2 seconds. Measurements generated from the on-board telemetry system and other sensors (such as GPS coordinates, acceleration/breaking, front camera video feeds, battery levels, mileage, vehicle's status indicating whether the engine is operating, doors are locked, and others) will be overlaid with publicly available data (such as street maps and places of interest, historical traffic conditions and accidents, speed limits, etc.) and mobile usage data (Evezy customers have to use the Evezy app to unlock and start the car, as well as to swap vehicle). Using this unique historical database, we will implement a robust risk scoring system whereby higher scores indicate riskier driving behaviour, and a tracking system for adaptively assigning risk scores and raising alerts in real-time.Machine learning methodologies will be used to processes the data to identify key characteristics. However, a standard black box algorithm approach may not have sufficient capacity to perform this task, the lack of descriptive power can create an impasse to being implemented for real-world purposes where risk to human safety is concerned. Therefore, while something like a deep neural network may be necessary to process and classify characteristics from a raw image data-set, the implications of the identified characteristics can be described by several possible flavours of Reinforcement Learning (RL); Deep RL, Model-Based RL, or even Hierarchical RL which creates an encoding of a kind of memory into the algorithm so as that sequences of events can be identified as potential problems not just the event at one particular instant of time. It may also be necessary to compare several different methods and optimise the trade off between computational efficiency and descriptive power.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0						2106499								University of Warwick				2023-12-08	GRANTS:15385882

FaiR-IoT: Fairness-aware Human-in-the-Loop Reinforcement Learning for Harnessing Human Variability in Personalized IoT								IoTDI '21: Proceedings of the International Conference on Internet-of-Things Design and Implementation								119	32				10.1145/3450268.3453525							Conference Paper	18 May 2021	2021	Thanks to the rapid growth in wearable technologies, monitoring complex human context becomes feasible, paving the way to develop human-in-the-loop IoT systems that naturally evolve to adapt to the human and environment state autonomously. Nevertheless, a central challenge in designing such personalized IoT applications arises from human variability. Such variability stems from the fact that different humans exhibit different behaviors when interacting with IoT applications (intra-human variability), the same human may change the behavior over time when interacting with the same IoT application (inter-human variability), and human behavior may be affected by the behaviors of other people in the same environment (multi-human variability). To that end, we propose FaiR-IoT, a general reinforcement learning-based framework for adaptive and fairness-aware human-in-the-loop IoT applications. In FaiR-IoT, three levels of reinforcement learning agents interact to continuously learn human preferences and maximize the system's performance and fairness while taking into account the intra-, inter-, and multi-human variability. We validate the proposed framework on two applications, namely (i) Human-in-the-Loop Automotive Advanced Driver Assistance Systems and (ii) Human-in-the-Loop Smart House. Results obtained on these two applications validate the generality of FaiR-IoT and its ability to provide a personalized experience while enhancing the system's performance by 40%-60% compared to non-personalized systems and enhancing the fairness of the multi-human systems by 1.5 orders of magnitude.

The methods need to provide a feasible trajectory for the vehicle to follow, fulfilling different requirements, such as safety, efficiency, and passenger comfort. In this area, algorithms must also meet strict real-time expectations, since, especially in an emergency, the decision time is limited, which raises a trade-off for the feasibility requirements. This article proposes a hierarchical path planning solution for evasive maneuvering, where a Twin Delayed DDPG reinforcement learning agent generates the parameters of a geometric path consisting of chlotoids and straight sections, and an underlying model predictive control loop fulfills the trajectory following tasks. The method is applied to the automotive double lane-change test, a common emergency situation, comparing its results with human drivers' performance using a dynamic simulation environment. Besides the test's standardized parameters, a broader range of topological layouts is chosen, both for the training and performance evaluation. The results show that the proposed method highly outperforms human drivers, especially in challenging situations, while meeting the computational requirements, as the pre-trained neural network and path generation algorithm can provide a solution in an instant, based on the experience gained during the training process.									13	0	0	0	2	0	13			2169-3536											Budapest Univ Technol & Econ, Dept Control Transportat & Vehicle Syst, H-1111 Budapest, Hungary				2020-11-17	WOS:000583564300001

However, it is a big challenge to provide a high quality, low latency, and low bitrate variance live streaming service for vehicles due to the dynamic properties of wireless resources and channels of IoV. To solve this challenge, we propose a novel live video transcoding and streaming scheme that maximizes the video bitrate and decreases time-delays and bitrate variations in vehicular fog-computing (VFC)-enabled IoV, by jointly optimizing vehicle scheduling, bitrate selection, and computational/spectrum resource allocation. This joint optimization problem is modeled as a Markov decision process (MDP), considering time-varying characteristics of the available resources and wireless channels of IoV. A soft actor-critic deep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithm that is based on the maximum entropy framework, is subsequently utilized to solve the above MDP. Extensive simulation results based on the data set of the real world show that compared to other baseline algorithms, the proposed scheme can effectively improve video quality while decreasing latency and bitrate variations, and access excellent performance in terms of learning speed and stability.									41	1	0	0	0	0	42			2327-4662											Shanxi Univ, Sch Phys & Elect Engn, Taiyuan 030006, Peoples R ChinaCarleton Univ, Dept Syst & Comp Engn, Ottawa, ON K1S 5B6, CanadaBeijing Univ Posts & Telecommun, Sch Informat & Commun Engn, Beijing 100876, Peoples R China				2021-02-17	WOS:000612146000005

However, these deep reinforcement learning algorithms, such as DQN and DDPG, have the problem of discontinuous action space and consistently overestimated Q values. To address this issue, a novel energy management strategy based on a twin delayed deep deterministic policy gradient (TD3) algorithm is proposed for the battery-ultracapacitor electric vehicles in this study. In addition, the driving condition recognition method is integrated into the energy management strategy framework to reduce the training time of the TD3 agent. The detailed implementation steps are as follows. At first, dynamic experiments were performed to establish high-precision models of the battery and ultracapacitor. Secondly, learning vector quantization neural networks are applied to classify driving conditions, namely, urban, suburban and highway conditions. Furthermore, three parallel TD3 agents are trained for urban, suburban and highway conditions, respectively. Finally, the proposed strategy is evaluated under standard driving cycles. The simulation results indicate that compared with the TD3-based strategy, the proposed strategy improves the economy by 1 % and reduces the training time by 34 %, and the economic gap with the dynamic programming-based energy management strategy is narrowed down to 3 %.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			2352-152X	2352-1538										Sichuan Univ Sci & Engn, Sch Mech Engn, 519 Huixing Rd, Zigong 643000, Sichuan, Peoples R ChinaChongqing Univ Technol, Sch Vehicle Engn, 69 Hongguang Rd, Chongqing 400054, Peoples R ChinaChongqing Univ, Coll Mech & Vehicle Engn, Chongqing 400044, Peoples R ChinaHarbin Inst Technol, Sch Automot Engn, Weihai 264209, Shandong, Peoples R China				2023-08-10	WOS:001038665900001

On the stability analysis of optimal state feedbacks as represented by deep neural models [arXiv]								arXiv								13 pp.	13 pp.											Journal Paper	6 Dec. 2018	2018	Research has shown how the optimal feedback control of several non linear systems of interest in aerospace applications can be represented by deep neural architectures and trained using techniques including imitation learning, reinforcement learning and evolutionary algorithms. Such deep architectures are here also referred to as Guidance and Control Networks, or G&CNETs. It is difficult to provide theoretical proofs on the control stability of such neural control architectures in general, and G&CNETs in particular, to perturbations, time delays or model uncertainties or to compute stability margins and trace them back to the network training process or to its architecture. In most cases the analysis of the trained network is performed via Monte Carlo experiments and practitioners renounce to any formal guarantee. This lack of validation naturally leads to scepticism especially in cases where safety and validation are of paramount importance such as is the case, for example, in the automotive or space industry. In an attempt to narrow the gap between deep learning research and control theory, we propose a new methodology based on differential algebra and automated differentiation to obtain formal guarantees on the behaviour of neural based control systems.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0																		2019-02-13	INSPEC:18379562

Unfortunately, exploration of difficult situations through test drives in natural traffic is ineffective due to the rarity of such events. While scenario-based testing in a virtual environment is often proposed as an effective method that helps to evaluate system performance in difficult situations, the manual definition of virtual test scenarios poses a significant challenge itself. Performance drops in tested systems, especially ones containing machine learning components, may be related to situations that are not necessarily considered challenging for a human driver and thus are difficult to predict in a test design. In this paper, we propose a method that allows to generate a variety of virtual test scenarios for ADAS through an adversarial trajectories generation. The method generates scenarios by finding trajectories of the road users in the proximity of the vehicle controlled by the tested algorithm that result in safety-critical events, such as collisions. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the presented method on an example of a critical scenario generation for a vehicle control policy based on Reinforcement Learning methods.					2021 25th International Conference on Methods and Models in Automation and Robotics (MMAR)2021 25th International Conference on Methods and Models in Automation and Robotics (MMAR)	23-26 Aug. 202123-26 Aug. 2021		Miedzyzdroje, PolandMiedzyzdroje, Poland	1	0	0	0	0	0	1					978-1-7281-7380-1									AGH Univ. of Sci. & Technol., Krakow, Poland				2021-12-18	INSPEC:21231079

To maintain an up-to-date map, we explore crowdsourcing data from connected vehicles. Updating the map collaboratively is, however, challenging under constrained transmission and computation resources in dynamic networks. In this paper, we propose EdgeMap, a crowdsourcing HD map to minimize the usage of network resources while maintaining the latency requirements. We design a DATE algorithm to adaptively offload vehicular data on a small time scale and reserve network resources on a large time scale, by leveraging the multi-agent deep reinforcement learning and Gaussian process regression. We evaluate the performance of EdgeMap with extensive network simulations in a time-driven end-to-end simulator. The results show that EdgeMap reduces more than 30% resource usage as compared to state-of-the-art solutions.

Different informed strategies for automatically tuning the tracker's parameters and to jointly learn the parameters and state/output sequence using: expectation maximization; optimization approaches, including the simplex algorithm; coordinate descent; genetic algorithms; nonlinear programming using finite differencing to estimate the gradient; Bayesian optimization and reinforcement learning; automatically tuning hyper-parameters in the least squares, were already proposed. We develop here a different semi-blind post-processing approach, which is faster and more robust. Starting from the conjecture that the trajectory is polynomial in Cartesian coordinates, our method supposes to fit the data obtained at the output of the tracker to a polynomial. We highlight, by simulations, the improvement of the estimated trajectory's accuracy using the polynomial fitting for single and multiple targets. We propose a new polynomial fitting method based on wavelets in two steps: denoising and polynomial part extraction, which compares favorably with the classical polynomial fitting method. The effect of the proposed post-processing methods is visible, the accuracy of targets' trajectories estimations being hardly increased.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1				2076-3417										Politehn Univ, Commun Dept, Timisoara 300223, Romania				2021-01-25	WOS:000605925900001

To improve driving safety, we explore to wirelessly share perception information among connected vehicles within automotive edge computing networks. Sharing massive perception data in real time, however, is challenging under dynamic networking conditions and varying computation work-loads. In this paper, we propose LiveMap, a real-time dynamic map, that detects, matches, and tracks objects on the road with crowdsourcing data from connected vehicles in sub-second. We develop the data plane of LiveMap that efficiently processes individual vehicle data with object detection, projection, feature extraction, object matching, and effectively integrates objects from multiple vehicles with object combination. We design the control plane of LiveMap that allows adaptive offloading of vehicle computations, and develop an intelligent vehicle scheduling and offloading algorithm to reduce the offloading latency of vehicles based on deep reinforcement learning (DRL) techniques. We implement LiveMap on a small-scale testbed and develop a large-scale network simulator. We evaluate the performance of LiveMap with both experiments and simulations, and the results show LiveMap reduces 34.1% average latency than the baseline solution.

To minimize the expected weighted sum of charging cost (sum of electricity and battery degradation costs) and EV owners' waiting cost, we formulate the problem as a Markov decision process with unknown state transition probability. Under a mild heavy-traffic assumption, we rigorously establish the optimality of the Less Demand First (LDF) priority rule under arbitrary system dynamics: batteries with less demand shall be charged first. The optimality result enables us to integrate the LDF rule into a state-of-the-art deep reinforcement learning (DRL) method, proximal policy optimization (PPO), reducing the dimensionality of its output from O(M+N) to O(1), without loss of optimality in the heavy-traffic scenario. Numerical results (on real-world data) demonstrate that the proposed LDF enhanced PPO approach significantly outperforms classical DRL methods and FCFS (first come, first served) priority rule based DRL counterparts.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			1949-3053	1949-3061										Donghua Univ, Coll Informat Sci & Technol, Shanghai 200051, Peoples R ChinaChinese Univ Hong Kong, Dept Mech & Automat Engn, Hong Kong, Peoples R ChinaCUHK Shenzhen Res Inst, Shenzhen 518172, Peoples R China				2024-01-29	WOS:001142510800007

The purpose of this paper is to evaluate the various collection methods used in RL under uncertain environment. Design/methodology/approach - An integrated fuzzy multi-criteria decision model has been developed for the evaluation of various collection methods. The evaluation has been done based on the criteria of initial investment, value added recovery, return volume, operating cost, degree of supply chain control, and level of customer satisfaction. The three alternatives used in the study are collection by the manufacturer directly from the customer, collection by the retailer, and collection by the third party. The fuzzy analytical hierarchy process has been used to compute the criteria weights and fuzzy technique for order preference by similarity to ideal solution has been used to rank the alternative collection methods. Fuzzy mathematics has been used to take care of uncertainties in the RL. Findings - Selection and evaluation of alternative collection methods is affected by multiple criteria like initial investment, value added recovery, return volume, operating cost, degree of supply chain control, and level of customer satisfaction. The utility of the proposed evaluation methodology has been validated by solving a case example from automotive company. Originality/value - The proposed methodology will provide a useful tool to the decision maker for the evaluation and selection of the alternative collection methods in RL. This will help companies in strategic decision making to prioritize and develop collection facilities accordingly.									16	0	0	0	0	1	16			1463-5771											Dept. of Mech. Eng. Dept., Birla Inst.

In order to guarantee safety when the application has real-time constraints, a critical requirement is to estimate the worst-case interference from other executing programs. However, the complexity of multi-core hardware inhibits precisely determining the Worst-Case Program Interference. Existing solutions are either prone to overestimate the interference or are not scalable to different hardware sizes and designs.In this paper we present Kryptonite, an automated framework to synthesize Worst-Case Program Interference (WCPI) environments for multi-core systems. Fundamental to Kryptonite is a set of tiny hardware-specific code gadgets that are crafted to maximize interference locally. The gadgets are arranged using a greedy approach and then molded using a Reinforcement Learning algorithm to create the WCPI environment.

In this direction, 5G technologies will make a great impulse providing low latency communication and computation at the edge of the network. First, this paper defines VMEC-in-a-Box, a smart RSU combined with a MEC station, aimed at providing edge computing for vehicular applications by enabling job offloading from vehicles. VMEC-in-a-Box is equipped with a microeolic power generator to be autonomous and self-consistent even in presence of low levels of wind. The behavior of VMEC-in-a-Box is controlled by artificial intelligence to vary its computing capacity dynamically to pursue the best tradeoff between performance and power consumption, and to cooperate by offloading jobs to each other (horizontal offload) to improve performance and reliability of the system. Hence, the paper defines a Markov model to support decisions to optimize by means of Reinforcement Learning the system behavior according to two reward functions defined at the MEC and at the Vehicular Domains. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work proposing an integrated framework to maximize reliability and performance at both Vehicular and MEC Domains.									8	0	0	0	0	0	8			2473-2400											Univ Palermo, Dipartimento Energia Ingn Informaz & Modelli Matem, I-90128 Palermo, ItalyUniv Catania, CNIT Res Unit, I-95125 Catania, ItalyUniv Catania, I-95125 Catania, Italy				2023-05-14	WOS:000966086900001

Despite the popularity of AI-enabled CPS, few benchmarks are publicly available. There is also a lack of deep understanding on the performance and reliability of AI-enabled CPS across different industrial domains. To bridge this gap, we present a public benchmark of industry-level CPS in seven domains and build AI controllers for them via state-of-the-art deep reinforcement learning (DRL) methods. Based on that, we further perform a systematic evaluation of these AI-enabled systems with their traditional counterparts to identify current challenges and future opportunities. Our key findings include (1) AI controllers do not always outperform traditional controllers, (2) existing CPS testing techniques (falsification, specifically) fall short of analyzing AI-enabled CPS, and (3) building a hybrid system that strategically combines and switches between AI controllers and traditional controllers can achieve better performance across different domains. Our results highlight the need for new testing techniques for AI-enabled CPS and the need for more investigations into hybrid CPS to achieve optimal performance and reliability.

The input current for each coil is calculated using a torque generating equation based on a torque map. If there is a difference between the analyzed and measured torque maps, this modeling error will reduce positioning accuracy. Permanent magnet type actuators can generate unexpected cogging torque due to various manufacturing errors. This manufacturing variation causes a torque map modeling error and significantly deteriorates the performance of conventional control systems using proportional-integral-differential (PID) controllers. Therefore, we propose a method to improve the positioning accuracy by introducing a compensator using reinforcement learning for the torque map modeling error pre-calculated by a 3-D finite element method (3-D FEM). We designed a simulation that assumes manufacturing variations in cogging torque and applied this current compensator to test its performance.					2022 23rd International Conference on the Computation of Electromagnetic Fields (COMPUMAG)2022 23rd International Conference on the Computation of Electromagnetic Fields (COMPUMAG)	16-20 Jan. 202216-20 Jan. 2022		Cancun, MexicoCancun, Mexico	0	0	0	0	0	0	0					978-1-6654-9863-0									Manuf.

Based on the new generation of information and communication technology--cloud control system(CCS) of intelligent and connected vehicles(ICVs), the cloud-level automatic driving of new energy vehicles is realized driven by connected data, which provides innovative planning and control ideas for vehicle driving and power systems. Firstly, based on the resource platform of CCS, the latitude, longitude, altitude, and weather of the target road are obtained, and a high definition(HD) path model including slope, curvature, and steering angle is established. Secondly, a deep reinforcement learning(DRL)-based integrated control method for hybrid electric vehicle(HEV) drive by the HD model is proposed. By adopting two DRL algorithms, the speed and steering of the vehicle and the engine and transmission in the powertrain are controlled, and the synchronous learning of four control strategies is realized. Finally, processor-in-the-loop(PIL) tests are performed by using the high-performance edge computing device NVIDIA Jetson AGX Xavier. The results show that under a variable space including 14 states and 4 actions, the DRL-based integrated control strategy realizes the precise control of the speed and steering of the vehicle layer under the high-speed driving cycle of 172 km, and achieves a fuel consumption of 5.53L/100km. Meanwhile, it only consumes 104.14s in the PIL test, which verifies the optimization and real-time performance of the learning-based multi-objective integrated control strategy.			在智能化、网联化与新能源化的发展背景下,汽车工业将联合计算机、信息通信、人工智能等领域实现融合性发展。基于新一代信息与通信技术智能网联汽车云控系统,通过网联数据驱动的形式实现新能源汽车的云控级自动驾驶,将为车辆行驶与动力系统提供革新的规划与控制思路。首先,基于云控系统的资源平台获取目标路段的经纬度、海拔、气象信息,建立包含坡度、曲率、转角等数据在内的高精度模型。其次,提出了一种基于高精地图驱动的深度强化学习型混合动力汽车集成控制方法,通过利用两种深度强化学习算法对整车层的速度与转向以及动力系统层的发动机与变速器进行控制,实现了四种控制策略的同步学习。最后,采用高性能边缘计算设备NVIDIA Jetson AGX Xavier进行了处理器在环测试。结果表明,当变量空间涉及14种状态与4种动作时,深度强化学习型集成控制策略在全程172 km的高速工况下实现了在整车层对速度与转向的精准控制,同时取得了5.53 L/100 km的燃油经济性,并且在嵌入式处理器在环测试中仅消耗104.14 s的计算时间,有效验证了学习型多目标集成控制策略的优化性与实时性。						0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0577-6686											重庆大学机械与运载工程学院, 重庆 400044, 中国清华大学, 汽车安全与节能国家重点实验室, 北京 100084, 中国College of Mechanical and Vehicle Engineering, Chongqing University, Chongqing 400044Tsinghua University, State Key Laboratory of Automotive Safety and Energy, Beijing 100084, China	重庆大学机械与运载工程学院清华大学College of Mechanical and Vehicle Engineering, Chongqing UniversityTsinghua University			2023-05-19	CSCD:7415672

To improve driving safety, we explore to wirelessly share perception information among connected vehicles within automotive edge computing networks. Sharing massive perception data in real time, however, is challenging under dynamic networking conditions and varying computation workloads. In this paper, we propose LiveMap, a real-time dynamic map, that detects, matches, and tracks objects on the road with crowdsourcing data from connected vehicles in sub-second. We develop the data plane of LiveMap that efficiently processes individual vehicle data with object detection, projection, feature extraction, object matching, and effectively integrates objects from multiple vehicles with object combination. We design the control plane of LiveMap that allows adaptive offloading of vehicle computations, and develop an intelligent vehicle scheduling and offloading algorithm to reduce the offloading latency of vehicles based on deep reinforcement learning (DRL) techniques. We implement LiveMap on a small-scale testbed and develop a large-scale network simulator. We evaluate the performance of LiveMap with both experiments and simulations, and the results show LiveMap reduces 34.1% average latency than the baseline solution.					40th IEEE Conference on Computer Communications (IEEE INFOCOM)40th IEEE Conference on Computer Communications (IEEE INFOCOM)	MAY 10-13, 2021MAY 10-13, 2021	IEEEIEEE	ELECTR NETWORKELECTR NETWORK	11	1	0	0	1	0	11			0743-166X		978-0-7381-1281-7									Univ North Carolina Charlotte, Charlotte, NC 28223 USAToyota Motor North Amer R&D InfoTech Labs, Mountain View, CA USA	Toyota Motor North Amer R&D InfoTech Labs			2021-01-01	WOS:000702210400206

These lead long-term spatial EV charging coordination (i.e., charging station (CS) selection) a non-convex optimization problem, which is yet an open issue. In this regard, by embedding SG millimeter-wave (mm W) access point (AP) into CS, an AP-enabled CS architecture is first devised in this paper to support VPP control information flow and EV communication applications, such as autonomous driving. Based on the AP-enabled CS, an AP-enabled-CS-assisted multi-agent deep reinforcement learning algorithm (ABC-MADRL) is proposed to provide an intelligent long-term EV charging coordination solution. Experimental results illustrate that ABC-MADRL dramatically reduces the power loss and voltage variance by 24.3%, compared to the uncoordinated charging.					2023 IEEE 3rd International Conference on Industrial Electronics for Sustainable Energy Systems (IESES)2023 IEEE 3rd International Conference on Industrial Electronics for Sustainable Energy Systems (IESES)	26-28 July 202326-28 July 2023		Shanghai, ChinaShanghai, China	0	0	0	0	0	0	0					979-8-3503-2475-4									UM-SJTU Joint Inst., Shanghai Jiao Tong Univ., Shanghai, ChinaGlobal Inst. of Future Technol., Shanghai Jiao Tong Univ., Shanghai, China				2023-10-12	INSPEC:23786153

J									Ahmed Elsheikh		Multi-level Reinforcement Learning for flow control																												Awarded Grant	Mar 31 2021	2021	Flow control is the process of targeted manipulation of fluid flow fields to accomplish a prescribed objective (e.g. reduce drag). Flow control uses information from the flow (provided by sensors) to adapt to incoming perturbations and adjust to changing flow conditions. General flow control is a largely unsolved mathematical problem appearing in many industries, including automotive, aerospace and environmental subsurface flow problems. The missing ingredient for turning flow control into a practical tool is the development of general flow control algorithms that can handle the following: (a) uncertainties in the system perturbations (e.g. the speed and direction of the perturbation), (b) uncertainties in the flow model parameters, (c) sparsity of the observations (i.e. partial and noisy observations) (d) modelling errors due to discretization and parameter upscaling.In this proposal, Reinforcement Learning (RL) algorithms will be utilized to learn general flow control polices using reliable simulated flow environments. From an application point of view, the developed mathematical techniques address flow control in two applications: (a) increasing energy efficiency in transportation trucks by flow control of incompressible Navier-Stokes flow past an obstacle and (b) safe and efficient storage of anthropogenic carbon dioxide (CO2) in deep geological formations using flow control in a Darcy-type subsurface flow. For the first application, road freight transportation accounts for approximately 5% of the UK's carbon footprint and flow control to reduce the aerodynamic drag could significantly improve the fuel efficiency, for example a 15% reduction in drag is equivalent to about 5% in fuel savings. For the CO2 storage application, the produced CO2 by human activities, for example from a power stations or an energy-intensive industries, could be injected into deep saline aquifers as a possible mitigation strategy to reduce anthropogenic emissions of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. The control of injection strategies in the subsurface storage sites, given the inherent uncertainties in the subsurface properties, would minimize the risk of leakage while maximising the storage capacity.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0						EP/V048899/1								Heriot-Watt University				2023-12-08	GRANTS:15406271

Deep Reinforcement Learning Algorithms for Hybrid V2X Communication: A Benchmarking Study [arXiv]								Deep Reinforcement Learning Algorithms for Hybrid V2X Communication: A Benchmarking Study [arXiv]																				Preprint	2024	2024	In today's era, autonomous vehicles demand a safety level on par with aircraft. Taking a cue from the aerospace industry, which relies on redundancy to achieve high reliability, the automotive sector can also leverage this concept by building redundancy in V2X (Vehicle-to-Everything) technologies. Given the current lack of reliable V2X technologies, this idea is particularly promising. By deploying multiple RATs (Radio Access Technologies) in parallel, the ongoing debate over the standard technology for future vehicles can be put to rest. However, coordinating multiple communication technologies is a complex task due to dynamic, time-varying channels and varying traffic conditions. This paper addresses the vertical handover problem in V2X using Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) algorithms. The goal is to assist vehicles in selecting the most appropriate V2X technology (DSRC/V-VLC) in a serpentine environment. The results show that the benchmarked algorithms outperform the current state-of-the-art approaches in terms of redundancy and usage rate of V-VLC headlights. This result is a significant reduction in communication costs while maintaining a high level of reliability. These results provide strong evidence for integrating advanced DRL decision mechanisms into the architecture as a promising approach to solving the vertical handover problem in V2X.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0																		2024-02-08	INSPEC:24500212

Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) has been gradually employed to solve CMfg scheduling problems and has achieved satisfactory performance in dynamic and uncertain cloud environments.

The proposal extracts intercorrelations in enterprise-enterprise and enterprise-task with the multi-head attention mechanism and is trained by DRL. Our proposal has extremely low time-response compared to heuristic algorithms and can generate a scheduling solution in seconds. In contrast to other DRL algorithms, our proposal can achieve better scheduling performances and uses a more accessible modeling method: the objective function alone is sufficient to train the model stably, without the need for a step-based reward function. Applying multi-head attention and DRL to scheduling problems is an exploratory attempt to achieve positive results. Experimental results on a case of automobile structure part processing in CMfg indicated that our proposal showed competitive scheduling performances and running time compared to eight DRL algorithms, two heuristic algorithms, and two priority dispatching rules. Besides, the results proved that our proposal's generalizability and scalability were better than the other eight DRL algorithms.									6	0	0	0	0	0	6			0278-6125	1878-6642										Beihang Univ, Sch Automat Sci & Elect Engn, Beijing 100191, Peoples R ChinaXidian Univ, Sch Mechanoelect Engn, Xian 710071, Peoples R ChinaBeijing Informat Sci & Technol Univ, Comp Sch, Beijing 100101, Peoples R China				2022-10-01	WOS:001125008700001

However, the traditional energy management strategy ignores the lifetime of the battery for good fuel economy. To overcome this drawback, a battery longevity-conscious energy manage-ment predictive control strategy is proposed based on the deep reinforcement learning algorithm predictive equivalent consumption minimization strategy (DRL-PECMS) in this study. To begin with, the back-propagation neural network is devised for predicting demand power, and the predictive equivalent consumption minimum strategy (PECMS) is proposed to improve the hydrogen consumption. Then, in order to improve the battery durability performance, the deep reinforcement learning algorithm is utilized to optimize the battery power and improve battery lifetime. Finally, numerical verification and hard-ware in the loop experiments are conducted to validate hydrogen consumption and battery durability performance of the proposed strategy. The validation results show that, compared with CD/CS and SQP(Sequential Quadratic Programming), the PECMS combined can achieve better fuel economy with the fuel consumption reduction by 55.6 % and 5.27 %, which effectively improves the fuel economy. The DRL-PECMS can reduce the effective Ah-throughput by 3.1 % compared with the PECMS. The numerous validations and comparisons demonstrate that the proposed strategy effectively accom-plishes the trade-off optimization between energy consumption and battery durability performance.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0360-5442	1873-6785										Chongqing Univ Arts & Sci, Sch Electr Informat & Elect Engn, Chongqing 402160, Peoples R ChinaFuzhou Univ, Coll Mech Engn & Automat, Fuzhou 350108, Peoples R China				2023-12-21	WOS:001119199500001

The existing model-driven stochastic optimization methods cannot fully consider the complex operating characteristics of the energy storage system and the uncertainty of photovoltaic power generation and electric vehicle charging load characteristics. Therefore, an optimal operation method for the entire life cycle of the energy storage system of the photovoltaic-storage charging station based on intelligent reinforcement learning is proposed. Firstly, the energy storage operation efficiency model and the capacity attenuation model are finely modeled. Then, the energy storage optimization operation strategy based on reinforcement learning was established with the goal of maximizing the revenue of photovoltaic charging stations, taking into account the uncertainty of electric vehicle charging demand, photovoltaic output, and electricity prices to satisfy the charging requirements and photovoltaic consumption of electric vehicles. A dual delay depth deterministic strategy gradient algorithm is used to solve the problem because of the continuity of decision-making actions for energy storage charging and discharging. The model is trained by the actual historical data, and the energy storage charging and discharging strategy is optimized in real time based on the current period status. Finally, the proposed method and model are tested, and the proposed method is compared with the traditional model-driven method. The results verify the effectiveness of the proposed method and model, and the revenue of optical storage charging stations throughout their energy storage life cycle is improved.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			0378-7788	1872-6178										China Elect Power Res Inst, Beijing Engn Technol Res Ctr Elect Vehicle Chargin, Beijing 100192, Peoples R ChinaXiongan New Dist Power Supply Co, State Grid Hebei Elect Power Co Ltd, Xiongan 050004, Hebei, Peoples R ChinaState Grid Corp China, Beijing 100031, Peoples R China	China Elect Power Res Inst			2024-02-03	WOS:001148983300001

The proposed framework utilizes the concept of Double Deep Q-learning Network (DDQN) in learning the maximum travel policy of the EV as an agent. The policy model is trained to estimate the agent's optimal action per the obtained reward signals and Q-values, representing the feasible routing options. The agent's energy requirement on the road is assessed following Markov Chain Model (MCM), with Markov's unit step represented as the average energy consumption that takes into consideration the different driving patterns, agent's surrounding environment, road conditions, and applicable restrictions. The framework offers a better exploration strategy, continuous learning ability, and the adoption of individual routing preferences. A real-time simulation in the python environment that considered real-life driving data from Google's API platform is performed. Results obtained for two geographically different drives show that the proposed energy consumption minimization framework reduced the energy utilization of the EVs to reach its intended destination by 5.89% and 11.82%, compared with Google's proposed routes originally. Both drives started at 4.30 PM on April 25th, 2019, in Los Angeles, California, and Miami, Florida, to reach EV's charging stations that are located six miles away from both of the starting locations.									28	1	0	0	0	0	30			0378-7796	1873-2046										Florida Int Univ, Dept Elect & Comp Engn, Energy Syst Res Labs, Miami, FL 33174 USA				2021-03-14	WOS:000613251300008

Finite Element Analysis of Reinforcement Rocker Part Made from JAC780Y Steel Sheets								Key Engineering Materials				877				83	9				10.4028/www.scientific.net/KEM.877.83							Journal Paper	2021	2021	The manufacturing industries for automotive parts aim to develop technologies for reducing vehicle weight in order to decrease fuel consumption. However, passive safety function for drivers and passengers must not be impaired or should be even improved. Therefore, advanced high strength steel sheet plays more and more important role in designing automotive components. Nowadays, prediction of formability for sheet metal stamping has high capability more than the past. The major challenge is springback prediction. Moreover, it assists in the tooling design to correctly compensate for springback. Especially in automotive production, springback effects have been generally exhibited distinct after forming process of the high strength steel sheets. The springback effect occurred in the deformed state of metal parts must be taken into account by designing any sheet metal panels. Then, the purpose of the present research is to investigate the springback phenomenon of an automotive part named Reinforcement Rocker RL made from an advanced high strength steel grade JAC780Y, after stamping. In addition, the tools design has been carried out. Finite Element (FE) program known as DYNAFORM (based on LS-DYNA solver), has been applied to analyze and improve the springback effect on such forming part. An anisotropic material model according to type 36 (MAT_036 3-PARAMETER_BARAT) was applied. The results obtained from simulations were compared with required parts in each section. Then, the die surface from compensation in 2nd step forming was modified to use. Finally, the simulation part was verified with the real stamping part. It was found that the finite element simulation showed high capability for prediction and compensation of springback in high strength steel sheets forming.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1013-9826											Fac. of Eng.

Due to the unpredictability of system behaviour in such situations, instabilities occur that lead to reduced production effectiveness. In order to deal with the resulting uncertainty, this paper presents an approach for self-directed systems capable of "learning", that is, they adapt their behaviour depending on the signals and changes of the circumfluent world. The advantages of such systems are significant, as they can react to changing products, production equipment and process constraints, and are able to function in exceptional situations. The presented concept makes use of reinforcement learning, one of the most general approaches to learning control. Simulations of three different ramp-up processes are used, where, as a demonstration, robots have to assemble windscreens on a moving truck.

End-to-End Deep Reinforcement Learning for Lane Keeping Assist [arXiv]								arXiv								9 pp.	9 pp.											Journal Paper	13 Dec. 2016	2016	Reinforcement learning is considered to be a strong AI paradigm which can be used to teach machines through interaction with the environment and learning from their mistakes, but it has not yet been successfully used for automotive applications. There has recently been a revival of interest in the topic, however, driven by the ability of deep learning algorithms to learn good representations of the environment. Motivated by Google DeepMind's successful demonstrations of learning for games from Breakout to Go, we will propose different methods for autonomous driving using deep reinforcement learning. This is of particular interest as it is difficult to pose autonomous driving as a supervised learning problem as it has a strong interaction with the environment including other vehicles, pedestrians and roadworks. As this is a relatively new area of research for autonomous driving, we will formulate two main categories of algorithms: 1) Discrete actions category, and 2) Continuous actions category. For the discrete actions category, we will deal with Deep Q-Network Algorithm (DQN) while for the continuous actions category, we will deal with Deep Deterministic Actor Critic Algorithm (DDAC). In addition to that, We will also discover the performance of these two categories on an open source car simulator for Racing called (TORCS) which stands for The Open Racing car Simulator. Our simulation results demonstrate learning of autonomous maneuvering in a scenario of complex road curvatures and simple interaction with other vehicles. Finally, we explain the effect of some restricted conditions, put on the car during the learning phase, on the convergence time for finishing its learning phase.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0														Valeo, Cairo, EgyptValeo, Paris, FranceValeo Vision Syst., Ireland				2017-05-25	INSPEC:16849552

How and Where?								IEEE ACCESS				9				141347	141359				10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3119915							Article	2021	2021	Autonomous driving (AD) provides a reliable solution for safe driving by replacing human drivers responsible for the majority of accidents. The emergence of Machine Learning, specifically Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL), and its ability to solve complex games proved its potential to address AD challenges. However, model-free methods still suffer from safety-related issues that can be resolved using safe-DRL approaches. The addition of model-based safety filters to the learning-based algorithms provides safety bounds on their performance and constraint satisfaction. In this paper, we investigate the addition of a safety filter based on Model Predictive Control and show an increase in mean testing episode reward by 110% from -75 mean episode reward during testing for 50 episodes for Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG) to 7.758. We study the impacts of safety filters (7.758 mean reward), heuristic rules, bounded additive noises (0.49% performance increase comparing to noise-free case), and exploration (3.425 mean reward) on the learning algorithm. We compare the effects of filters in the context of simulated exploration and bounded exploration and prove that bounded exploration results in 9.86% increase in mean reward and 12.95% decrease in std comparing to the other method. Additionally, inspired by Deep Internal Learning and biological mechanisms like brain plasticity, we investigate the idea of using each sample for training only once instead of utilizing stochastic batches which increases the mean testing accumulated reward by 1.87% and leads to the best performance (7.942 mean reward and 0.048 std). Finally, the results demonstrate better automotive results for our proposed method than DDPG. Our proposed method, DDPG with safety filter in bounded exploration and adaptive learning under noisy input conditions, has a success rate of 100% under different traffic densities for the simulation environment used in this paper and our assumptions. The proposed method's automotive results are shown for a braking scenario to avoid collision with other road users.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			2169-3536											Univ Waterloo, Dept Syst Design Engn, SHEVS Lab, Waterloo, ON N2L 3G1, CanadaUniv Waterloo, Fac Engn, Dept Syst Design Engn, Waterloo, ON N2L 3G1, Canada				2021-11-11	WOS:000711699300001

Specifically, we focus on partially observable Markov decision processes (POMDPs), which have recently been proposed as a statistical framework for building dialogue managers (DMs). These statistical DMs have explicit models of uncertainty, which allow alternative recognition hypotheses to be exploited, and dialogue management policies that can be optimised automatically using reinforcement learning. This paper presents a voice-based in-car system for providing information about local amenities (e.g. restaurants). A user trial is described which compares performance of a trained statistical dialogue manager with a conventional handcrafted system. The results demonstrate the differing behaviours of the two systems and the performance advantage obtained when using the statistical approach.					4th International Conference on Applied Human Factors and Ergonomics (AHFE)4th International Conference on Applied Human Factors and Ergonomics (AHFE)	JUL 21-25, 2012JUL 21-25, 2012		San Francisco, CASan Francisco, CA	0	0	0	0	0	0	0					978-1-4398-7124-9; 978-1-4398-7123-2									Univ Cambridge, Dept Engn, Cambridge CB2 1TN, EnglandGen Motors Adv Tech Ctr Israel, Jerusalem, Israel				2013-01-01	WOS:000365217000075

However, due to the dynamic characteristics of wireless links and topology of vehicular networks, providing high quality, low latency, and low variance video streaming for vehicles is a big challenge. This study aims to maximize video quality while decreasing time-delays and bitrate switches in vehicular fog computing (VFC) systems, by jointly optimizing vehicle scheduling, bitrate selection, computational and spectrum resource allocation. Considering the dynamic characteristics of vehicular networks and available computational/spectrum resource, the above problem is modeled as a Markov decision process (MDP). Since the action space of the MDP is multi-dimensional continuous variables mixed with discrete variables, the study utilizes an actor-critic deep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithm to resolve the MDP problem. Extensive simulation results based on the dataset of the real world show the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.					39th IEEE International Conference on Computer Communications (IEEE INFOCOM)39th IEEE International Conference on Computer Communications (IEEE INFOCOM)	JUL 06-09, 2020JUL 06-09, 2020	IEEEIEEE	ELECTR NETWORKELECTR NETWORK	2	1	0	0	0	0	3			2159-4228		978-1-7281-8695-5									Shanxi Univ, Sch Phys & Elect Engn, Taiyuan, Shanxi, Peoples R ChinaCarleton Univ, Dept Syst & Comp Engn, Ottawa, ON, Canada				2020-12-31	WOS:000593830400168

PointNet is a recently developed deep neural network capable of identifying objects from 3D scenes (point clouds) irrespective of their position and orientation. PointNet was used to recognise 12 instances of components of turbochargers for automotive engines. These instances included different mechanical parts, as well as different models of the same part. Point clouds of partial views of the parts were created from CAD models using a purpose-developed depth-camera simulator, reproducing various levels of sensor imprecision. Experimental evidence indicated PointNet can be consistently trained to recognise with accuracy the objects. In the presence of sensor imprecision, the accuracy in the recall phase can be increased adding stochastic error to the training examples. Training 12 independent classifiers, one for each part, did not yield significant improvements in accuracy compared to using one classifier for all the parts.

In this paper, we present our research results on the implementation of adaptive critic designs for self-learning control of automotive engines. A class of adaptive critic designs that can be classified as'(model-free) action-dependent heuristic dynamic programming is used in this research project. The goals of the present learning control design for automotive engines include improved performance, reduced emissions, and maintained optimum performance under various operating conditions. Using the data from a test vehicle with a V8 engine, we developed a neural network model of the engine and neural network controllers based on the idea of approximate dynamic programming to achieve optimal control. We have developed and simulated self-learning neural network controllers for both engine torque (TRQ) and exhaust air-fuel ratio (AFR) control. The goal of TRQ control and AFR control is to track the commanded values. For both control problems; excellent neural network controller transient performance has been achieved.									112	11	0	0	3	0	126			1083-4419	1941-0492										Univ Illinois, Dept Elect & Comp Engn, Chicago, IL 60607 USAGen Motors Res & Dev Ctr, Powertrain Syst Res Lab, Warren, MI 48090 USAMcMaster Carr, Elmhurst, IL 60126 USA	McMaster Carr			2008-08-01	WOS:000258183100016	18632389

Proposition of a Framework for Classifying Returnable Transport Items Closed-Loop/Reverse Logistics Issues								IFAC PAPERSONLINE				52	13			1955	1960				10.1016/j.ifacol.2019.11.489							Proceedings Paper	2019	2019	In this paper, we propose a conceptual framework for classifying operations management-related issues for returnable transport items (RTI). RTI closed-loop supply chain (CLSC) issues are classified into three categories. Our proposal is based on a global literature review in the field of CLSC and reverse logistics (RL), with a specific focus on transport items reuse. We also derive our work from observations made in the automotive industry. The motivation for dealing with this topic is that more and more companies are adopting RTIs in their supply chain, and despite the growing attention that CLSC and RL research have gained during the last years, the focus is still more oriented toward remanufacturing issues. The objectives of this paper are twofold. Firstly, to provide practitioners with a clear vision on different issues that arise when implementing a RTI system from an operations management point of view, and secondly, to give suggestions to researchers regarding existing gaps that still need to be filled in this field.

For most time-sensitive and computation-intensive vehicular services, the data offloading process significantly influences the capacity and performance of MEC, especially when the number of connected vehicles is enormous. In this work, we consider data offloading optimization for a large-scale automotive MEC network. The problem is challenging due to the large number of connected vehicles and the complicated interaction between vehicles and edge servers. To tackle the scalability problem, we reformulate the original offloading optimization problem into a Mean-Field-Game (MFG) problem by abstracting the interaction among the connected vehicles as a distribution over their state spaces of task sizes, known as the mean-field term. To solve the problem efficiently, we propose a G-prox Primal-Dual-Hybrid-Gradient (PDHG) algorithm that transforms the MFG problem into a saddle-point problem. Based on our developed MFG model and G-prox PDHG algorithm, we propose the first data offloading scheme whose computation time is independent of the number of connected vehicles in automotive MEC systems. Extensive evaluation results corroborate the superior performance of our proposed scheme compared with the state-of-the-art methods.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			0018-9545	1939-9359										Univ Houston, Elect & Comp Engn Dept, Houston, TX 77004 USAGeorgia State Univ, Dept Comp Sci, Atlanta, GA 30303 USADaegu Gyeongbuk Inst Sci & Technol, Dept Elect Engn & Comp Sci, Daegu 42988, South KoreaUniv N Carolina, Dept Elect & Comp Engn, Charlotte, NC 28223 USARyerson Univ, Dept Elect Comp & Biomed Engn, Toronto, ON M5B 2K3, CanadaKyung Hee Univ, Dept Comp Sci & Engn, Seoul 446701, South Korea				2023-06-24	WOS:000991849700070

However, if the electricity used to charge EVs is derived from fossil fuels, this does not necessarily imply a reduction of overall emissions nationally or globally. To achieve optimal EV charging, a deeper comprehension of the unpredictability of on-site renewable energy sources (ORES) energy output is required. In this paper, the predicted renewable energy generated is used as the actual value for the reinforcement learning algorithm simulation environment. Such a model can represent the relationship between the power generation and the wind speed as well as solar irradiation, which are characterized by significant uncertainties. The uncertainty analysis shows that the wind speed at Newcastle upon Tyne can be modelled as a Weibull distribution with parameters A = 19.98 and B = 1.91. As for energy demand, this paper integrates information from an Oslo (Norway) car parking garage-based set of EV charging stations with EVs' demand statistics. The charging habits of EV users range from 800 min to 1,000 min of parking time, and from 5 kWh to 20 kWh in terms of charging energy. The maximum connection frequency for EV charging is 20 min. In addition, this paper develops methods for stochastic EV charging and parking space occupancy employing actual data. Based on the aforesaid renewable energy generation and the EV charging status, it is possible to develop a decision algorithm to optimal renewable energy efficiency.					3rd International Symposium on New Energy and Electrical Technology (ISNEET)3rd International Symposium on New Energy and Electrical Technology (ISNEET)	AUG 25-25, 2022AUG 25-25, 2022		Anyang, PEOPLES R CHINAAnyang, PEOPLES R CHINA	0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1876-1100	1876-1119	978-981-99-0555-3; 978-981-99-0553-9; 978-981-99-0552-2									Northumbria Univ, Dept Math Phys & Elect Engn, Newcastle Upon Tyne NE1 8ST, Tyne & Wear, EnglandNorthumbria Univ, RENU, Newcastle Upon Tyne NE1 8ST, Tyne & Wear, EnglandWuhan Univ, Sch Cyber Sci & Engn, Wuhan, Peoples R China				2023-07-14	WOS:001008055900102

Efficient statistical validation with edge cases to evaluate Highly Automated Vehicles								2020 IEEE 23rd International Conference on Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITSC)								8 pp.	8 pp.				10.1109/ITSC45102.2020.9294590							Conference Paper	2020	2020	The widescale deployment of Autonomous Vehicles (AV) seems to be imminent despite many safety challenges that are yet to be resolved. It is well known that there are no universally agreed Verification and Validation (VV) methodologies to guarantee absolute safety, which is crucial for the acceptance of this technology. Existing standards focus on deterministic processes where the validation requires only a set of test cases that cover the requirements. Modern autonomous vehicles will undoubtedly include machine learning and probabilistic techniques that require a much more comprehensive testing regime due to the non-deterministic nature of the operating design domain. A rigourous statistical validation process is an essential component required to address this challenge. Most research in this area focuses on evaluating system performance in large scale real-world data gathering exercises (number of miles travelled), or randomised test scenarios in simulation. This paper presents a new approach to compute the statistical characteristics of a systems behaviour by biasing automatically generated test cases towards the worst case scenarios, identifying potential unsafe edge cases. We use reinforcement learning (RL) to learn the behaviours of simulated actors that cause unsafe behaviour measured by the well established RSS safety metric. We demonstrate that by using the method we can more efficiently validate a system using a smaller number of test cases by focusing the simulation towards the worst case scenario, generating edge cases that correspond to unsafe situations.					2020 IEEE 23rd International Conference on Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITSC)2020 IEEE 23rd International Conference on Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITSC)	20-23 Sept. 202020-23 Sept. 2020		Rhodes, GreeceRhodes, Greece	0	0	0	0	0	0	0					978-1-7281-4149-7									Australian Centre for Field Robot., Univ. of Sydney, Sydney, NSW, Australia				2021-02-19	INSPEC:20302937

This paper explores a cloud-based multi-objective energy management strategy for the hybrid architecture with a deep deterministic policy gradient, which increases the electrical and thermal safety, and meanwhile minimizes the system's energy loss and aging cost. In order to simulate the electro-thermal dynamics and aging behaviors of the batteries, models are built for both high-energy and high-power cells based on the characterization and aging tests. A cloud-based training approach is proposed for energy management with real-world vehicle data collected from various road conditions. Results show the improvement of electrical and thermal safety, as well as the reduction of energy loss and aging cost of the whole system with the proposed strategy based on the collected real-world driving data. Furthermore, processor-in-the-loop tests verify that the proposed strategy can achieve a much higher convergence rate and a better performance in terms of the minimization of both energy loss and aging cost compared with state-of-the-art learning-based strategies.									40	3	0	0	0	0	43			0306-2619	1872-9118										Rhein Westfal TH Aachen, Inst Power Elect & Elect Drives ISEA, Chair Electrochem Energy Convers & Storage Syst, Jaegerstr 17-19, D-52066 Aachen, GermanyJARA Energy, Juelich Aachen Res Alliance, Aachen, GermanyForschungszentrum Julich, Helmholtz Inst Munster HI MS, IEK 12, Julich, GermanyBeijing Inst Technol, Sch Mech Engn, Natl Engn Lab Elect Vehicles, Beijing 100081, Peoples R ChinaTsinghua Univ, Sch Vehicle & Mobil, State Key Lab Automot Safety & Energy, Beijing 100084, Peoples R ChinaTongji Univ, Natl Fuel Cell Vehicle & Powertrain Syst Res & En, Sch Automot Studies, Shanghai 201804, Peoples R China	JARA Energy			2021-06-04	WOS:000649311400009

Based on this, we model the time resource allocation problem as a Markov Decision Process (MDP), and design the Q-learning and the Double Deep Q-learning Network (DDQN) algorithms to optimize the allocation of time resources for radar and communication functions dynamically. The simulation results show that compared with the Round-robin algorithm, the Q-learning and the DDQN algorithms can increase the communication data throughput by more than 6.6% and reduce the miss detection probability by more than 29.4%.

The screen has a privileged axis (AP) so that a beam parallel light illuminating the entrance face with an incidence along the privileged axis is refracted in a parallel beam propagating in the screen directly to the face of output. An optical reflector (RL) remote from the screen is positioned and arranged to reflect a light beam from a light source (SL) in the parallel beam. Each light source is offset from the axis, where a cross-section of the screen along the axis has a dimension. USE - Optical device (DO) for a motor vehicle (claimed) e.g. automotive type vehicle for performing a photometric function, such as a regulatory function of reversing and rear fog lights. ADVANTAGE - The optical reflector reduces the loss of light power by using an increased number of light sources or by using more powerful LEDs. The reflector increases the optical path, thus increasing the light energy absorbed by the flat guide. The internal reflections cause a significant diffusion of light through the exit face, since the light rays emitted by the exit face have multiple directions, resulting from internal reflections.

Mobile network operator (MNO) selection and switching problem is formulated by jointly considering switching cost, quality-of-service (QoS) variations between MNOs, and the different prices that can be charged by different MNOs as well as cloud and fog servers. A double deep Q network (DQN) based switching policy is proposed and proved to be able to minimize the long-term average cost of each vehicle with guaranteed latency and reliability performance. The performance of the proposed approach is evaluated using the dataset collected in a commercially available city-wide LTE network.

The basic element of the approach is the notion of so-called maneuvers, which allow to cast the nonlinear and non-convex planning task into a highly structured optimal control problem. This can be solved quite efficiently, but not fast enough for online operation when considering nonlinear vehicle models. Therefore, the approach proposed in this paper aims at approximating solutions using a supervised learning approach: First, training data are generated by solving optimal control problems and are then used to train a neural network. As is demonstrated for a cooperative overtaking maneuver, this approach shows good performance, while (contrasting approaches like reinforcement learning) requiring only low training effort.

This article examines the use of AI methods for clutch development and provides an overview based on various application examples in current Mercedes-Benz AG research projects. By means of supervised learning and deep neural networks, a friction coefficient model and a temperature model of a clutch with high accuracy are developed. Reinforcement learning with deep neural networks is used to synthesize controllers for various gear changes. Vehicle measurement data is analyzed using cluster algorithms to derive action recommendations for the application of the engine restart of a hybrid drivetrain. The methods shown increase the automation potential in development and may reduce the effort required to adopt complex development processes for new transmission variants and generations.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0015-7899	1434-0860										Mercedes Benz AG, Stuttgart, GermanyIPEK Inst Produktentwicklung Karlsruher Inst Techn, Karlsruhe, GermanyMercedes Benz AG, Sindelfingen, Germany	IPEK Inst Produktentwicklung Karlsruher Inst Techn			2023-05-18	WOS:000984590500001

The two antennas are a transmit (TX) 1 x 8 slot array antenna with a size of 1 x 23 mm and a receive (RX) 8 x 8 slot array antenna with a size of 15 x 23 mm. Promising performance has been measured with the TX and RX subarray antennas (gain >4 dBi) with good matching to 50 Omega (RL > 10 dB) in the frequency range 70-90 GHz. By using a metal cavity, mounted on the back of the antenna, potential parallel plate or cavity modes could be reduced and the gain could also be increased by 2 dB. The measured and the simulated results are consistent.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1759-0787	1759-0795										Acreo AB Innovat Elect, SE-60117 Norrkoping, SwedenUppsala Univ, SE-75151 Uppsala, Sweden	Acreo AB Innovat Elect			2010-08-01	WOS:000208629100009

At the same time decreasing pollutant emission limits must be met also under real driving conditions. This trade-off between fuel consumption and pollutant emissions needs to be optimized, which results in powertrains with increasing complexity. A holistic energy and emission management is needed to control such systems in a way that the fuel consumption is minimized while emission limits are respected.Mathematical optimization methods are difficult to apply in real-time applications due to high computational and calibration demands. Self-learning algorithms, on the other hand, seem to be a suitable solution for such optimization problems.In this paper a control strategy for a hybrid electrical vehicle is presented, consisting of a decision-making agent, trained on different test drives with Reinforcement Learning. For these, the Proximal Policy Optimization method was applied. The strategy controls the torque-split between the combustion engine and electric motor, the power of an electrically heated catalyst and internal engine measures. The method is demonstrated in a simulation framework based on a Diesel P0-HEV with a SCR exhaust gas aftertreatment system. In comparison to a reference strategy a fuel reduction of 3.1 % averaged over the test data set was achieved. (C) 2019, IFAC (International Federation of Automatic Control) Hosting by Elsevier Ltd.

More specifically, we investigate scalable models and protocols for various distributed consensus coordination problems in large-scale MAS. Examples of such problems include conflict avoidance, leader election and coalition formation. We are particularly interested in application domains where robotic or unmanned vehicle agents interact with each other in real-time, as they try to jointly complete various tasks in complex dynamic environments, and where decisions often need to be made "on the fly". Such MAS applications, we argue, necessitate a multi-tiered approach to learning how to coordinate effectively. One such collaborative MAS application domain is ensembles of autonomous micro unmanned aerial vehicles (micro-UAVs). A large ensemble of micro-UAVs on a complex, multi-stage mission comprised of many diverse tasks with varying time and other resource requirements provides an excellent framework for studying multi-tiered learning how to better coordinate. A variety of tasks and their resource demands, complexity and unpredictability of the overall environment, types of coordination problems that the UAVs may encounter in the course of their mission, multiple time scales at which the overall system can use learning and adaptation in order to perform better in the future, and multiple logical and organizational levels at which large ensembles of micro-UAVs can be analyzed and optimized, all suggest the need for a multi-tiered approach to learning. We outline our theoretical and conceptual framework that integrates reinforcement learning and meta-learning, and discuss potential benefits that our framework could provide for enabling autonomous micro-UAVs (and other types of autonomous vehicles) to coordinate more effectively.					19th European Conference on Artificial Intelligence (ECAI)/6th Conference on Prestigious Applications of Intelligent Systems (PAIS)19th European Conference on Artificial Intelligence (ECAI)/6th Conference on Prestigious Applications of Intelligent Systems (PAIS)	AUG 16-20, 2010AUG 16-20, 2010	European Coordinating Comm Artificial Intelligence (ECCAI); Agreement Technol; Portuguese Assoc Artificial Intelligence (APPIA); Artificial Intelligence Journal; Fundacao Luso-Amer (FLAD); Lab Agent Modelling (LabMAg); PRIMAVERA Business Software Solut; SISCOG (Sistemas Cognitivos)European Coordinating Comm Artificial Intelligence (ECCAI); Agreement Technol; Portuguese Assoc Artificial Intelligence (APPIA); Artificial Intelligence Journal; Fundacao Luso-Amer (FLAD); Lab Agent Modelling (LabMAg); PRIMAVERA Business Software Solut; SISCOG (Sistemas Cognitivos)	Univ Lisbon, Fac Sci, Lisbon, PORTUGALUniv Lisbon, Fac Sci, Lisbon, PORTUGAL	2	0	0	0	0	0	2			0922-6389	1879-8314	978-1-60750-605-8; 978-1-60750-606-5									Univ Houston, Dept Comp Sci, Houston, TX 77204 USA				2010-01-01	WOS:000306373200027		
J	Xinyu Huang; Lijun He; Wanyue Zhang										Vehicle Speed Aware Computing Task Offloading and Resource Allocation Based on Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning in a Vehicular Edge Computing Network [arXiv]								arXiv								8 pp.	8 pp.											Journal Paper	14 Aug. 2020	2020	For in-vehicle application, the vehicles with different speeds have different delay requirements. However, vehicle speeds have not been extensively explored, which may cause mismatching between vehicle speed and its allocated computation and wireless resource. In this paper, we propose a vehicle speed aware task offloading and resource allocation strategy, to decrease the energy cost of executing tasks without exceeding the delay constraint. First, we establish the vehicle speed aware delay constraint model based on different speeds and task types. Then, the delay and energy cost of task execution in VEC server and local terminal are calculated. Next, we formulate a joint optimization of task offloading and resource allocation to minimize vehicles' energy cost subject to delay constraints. MADDPG method is employed to obtain offloading and resource allocation strategy. Simulation results show that our algorithm can achieve superior performance on energy cost and task completion delay.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0														Sch. of Inf. & Commun.

Therefore, it is necessary to integrate driving behavior in EMS to reduce the fuel consumption and improve the lifespan of power sources. In this paper, a driving-behavior-aware adaptive deep-reinforcement-learning (DRL) based EMS is proposed for a three-power-source fuel cell hybrid electric vehicle (FCHEV). To fully utilize each power source, a hierarchical power splitting method is adopted by an adaptive fuzzy filter. Then, a high-performance driving behavior recognizer is employed, and Pontryagin's minimum principle (PMP) method is used to compute the optimal equivalent factor (EF) of each driving behavior. To realize a trade-off between global learning and real-time implementation, an improved multi-learning-space DRL-based algorithm, applying driving-behavior-aware adaptive equivalent consumption minimization strategy (A-ECMS) and soft learning mechanism, is proposed and verified by a series of simulations. Simulation results show that, compared with the benchmark method ECMS, the proposed P-DQL method can reduce the hydrogen consumption by 49.9% on average, and the total cost to use by 31.4% , showing a promising ability to increase fuel economy and reduce hydrogen consumption and the total cost to use of FCHEV.									7	0	0	0	0	0	7			1524-9050	1558-0016										Henan Univ Sci & Technol, Coll Informat Engn, Luoyang 471023, Peoples R ChinaHenan Univ Sci & Technol, Longmen Lab, Luoyang 471023, Peoples R ChinaHenan Univ Sci & Technol, Coll Informat Engn, Luoyang 471023, Peoples R ChinaHenan Univ Sci & Technol, Henan Key Lab Robot & Intelligent Syst, Luoyang 471023, Peoples R ChinaHenan Univ Sci & Technol, Coll Vehicle & Traff Engn, Luoyang 471023, Peoples R China				2023-01-24	WOS:000910578300001

The SAE J2954 RP establishes criteria for interoperability, electromagnetic compatibility (EMC), electromagnetic field (EMF) safety, etc. The aim of this study was to predict the magnetic field behavior inside and outside an EV during wireless charging using the design criteria of SAE RP J2954. Analyzing the worst case configurations of WPT coils and EV bodyshell by a sophisticated software tool based on the finite element method (FEM) that takes into account the field reflection and refraction of the metal EV bodyshell, it is possible to numerically assess the magnetic field levels in the environment. The investigation was performed considering the worst case configurationa small city car with a Class 2 WPT system of 7.7 kVA with WPT coils with maximum admissible ground clearance and offset. The results showed that the reference level (RL) of the International Commission on Non-Ionizing Radiation Protection (ICNIRP) guidelines in terms of magnetic flux density was exceeded under and beside the EV. To mitigate the magnetic field, the currents flowing through the WPT coils were varied using the inductor-capacitor-capacitor (LCC) compensation instead of the traditional series-series (SS) compensation. The corresponding calculated field was compliant with the 2010 ICNIRP RL and presented a limited exceedance of the 1998 ICNIRP RL. Finally, the influence of the body width on the magnetic field behavior adopting maximum offset was investigated, demonstrating that the magnetic field emission in the environment increased as the ground clearance increased and as the body width decreased.									36	0	0	0	1	0	38				1996-1073										Univ Aquila, Dept Ind & Informat Engn & Econ, I-67100 Laquila, ItalySapienza Univ Rome, Dept Astronaut Elect & Energet Engn, I-00184 Rome, Italy				2019-06-14	WOS:000469761700211

Consequently, they are more suitable for model-based energy management. However, distinctions be-tween work cycles result in adverse scenarios for generalizing model-based energy management. In this study, we solve this problem by proposing a generalized strategy using a model-based reinforcement learning framework. The generalized design highlights three aspects: 1) long-term stability, 2) self-learning ability, and 3) state transition model reuse. A reward function with a trend term is proposed to avoid the cumulative errors between operation cycles and improve the long-term stability of learning. In addition, Gaussian process regression is leveraged to approximate the value function, thereby reducing the computational load and improving the learning efficiency. To further enhance the reusability of the environmental model, a modelling method based on the Gaussian mixture model is put forward. Finally, a generalized HCV energy management framework that includes offline and online learning is designed, where a pre-learning model and an approximation function are adopted for reuse and dynamic learning. Simulation results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed framework to conventional model-based methods in terms of stability, generality, and adaptability, accompanied by a reduction of 5.9% in fuel consumption.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			0360-5442	1873-6785										Jilin Univ, Sch Mech & Aerosp Engn, Changchun 130012, Peoples R ChinaState Key Lab Smart Mfg Special Vehicles & Transm, Baotou 014030, Peoples R ChinaHuazhong Univ Sci & Technol, State Key Lab Digital Mfg Equipment & Technol, Wuhan, Peoples R China	State Key Lab Smart Mfg Special Vehicles & Transm			2022-09-08	WOS:000848498700003

Equipment failures can be very costly and have catastrophic consequences. In its basic concept, Predictive maintenance allows minimizing equipment faults or service disruptions, presenting promising cost savings. This paper presents a data-driven approach, based on multiple-instance learning, to predict malfunctions in End-of-Line Testing Systems through the extraction of operational logs, which, while not designed to predict failures, contains valid information regarding their operational mode over time. For the case study performed, a real-life dataset was used containing thousands of log messages, collected in a real automotive industry environment. The insights gained from mining this type of data will be shared in this paper, highlighting the main challenges and benefits, as well as good recommendations, and best practices for the appropriate usage of machine learning techniques and analytics tools that can be implemented in similar industrial environments.

We address this by proposing an integrated interdisciplinary approach that uses natural language processing and machine learning techniques to formalize multilingual patent information in an ontology. The ontology further contains patent and domain specific knowledge, which allows for aligning patents with technological fields of interest and other business-related artifacts. Our empirical evaluation shows that for categorizing patents according to well-known technological fields of interest, the approach achieves high accuracy with selected feature sets compared to related work focussing on monolingual patents. We further show that combining OWL RL reasoning with SPARQL querying over the patent knowledge base allows for answering complex business queries and illustrate this with real-world use cases from the automotive domain.					2016 IEEE Symposium Series on Computational Intelligence (SSCI)2016 IEEE Symposium Series on Computational Intelligence (SSCI)	6-9 Dec. 20166-9 Dec. 2016	IEEEIEEE	Athens, GreeceAthens, Greece	0	0	0	0	0	0	0					978-1-5090-4240-1									Inst. of Artificial Intell., Ulm Univ., Ulm, Germany				2017-03-09	INSPEC:16670560

Automotive original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) are even more involved in the expected vehicle recovery network modifications. As a consequence, one of the most critical and challenging issues for reverse logistics (RL) management is the development of effective tools to support strategic, tactical and operational decisions to yield the maximum economic benefit in compliance with the reference regulations. In this paper, a mixed integer linear programming (MILP) model for ELV closed-loop network design is proposed. The network cost minimisation objective function, the integration of forward and reverse logistics and the inclusion of remanufacturing activities for vehicle module reuse represent the model key features. The proposed model is, further, applied on a realistic Italian case-study and the results of a sensitivity analysis are presented to identify the parameters most affecting the model outcomes.									11	1	0	0	3	0	12			1742-7967											Dept. of Ind.

This paper describes the application of multi-player bandit algorithms for waveform selection to a distributed cognitive radar network that must coexist with a communications system. Specifically, we make the assumption that radar nodes in the network have no dedicated communication channel. As we will discuss later, nodes can communicate indirectly by taking actions which intentionally interfere with other nodes and observing the resulting collisions. The radar nodes attempt to optimize their own spectrum utilization while avoiding collisions, not only with each other, but with the communications system. The communications system is assumed to statically occupy some subset of the bands available to the radar network. First, we examine models that assume each node experiences equivalent channel conditions, and later examine a model that relaxes this assumption.

The social benefits of CAEVs are manifested in the form of safer transportation, lower energy consumption, and reduced congestion and emissions. Nevertheless, it is highly difficult to design driving policies that ensure road safety, travel efficiency, and energy conservation for all CAEVs in traffic flows, particularly in a mixed-autonomy scenario where both CAEVs and human-driven vehicles (HDVs) are on the road and interact with each other. Here we present a novel deep multiagent reinforcement learning (DMARL)-enabled energy-aware cooperative driving solution, facilitating CAEVs to learn vehicular platoon management policies for guaranteeing overall traffic flow performance. Specifically, with the aid of information communication technology (ICT), CAEVs can share their vehicle state and learned knowledge, such as their state of charge (SoC), speed, and driving policies. Additionally, a cooperative multiagent actor-critic (CMAAC) technique is developed to optimize vehicular platoon management policies that map perceptual information directly to the group decision-making behaviors for the CAEV platoon. The proposed approach is evaluated in highway on-ramp merging scenarios with two different mixed-autonomy traffic flows. The results demonstrate the benefits of our scheme. Finally, we discuss the challenges and potential research directions for the proposed energy-aware cooperative driving solution.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			1556-6072	1556-6080										Nanyang Technol Univ, Singapore 639798, Singapore				2023-08-15	WOS:001040624000001

However, the current DRL-based strategies suffer from insufficient constraint capability, slow learning speed, and unstable convergence. In this study, a state-of-the-art continuous control DRL algorithm, softmax deep double deterministic policy gradients (SD3), is used to develop the energy management system of a power-split HEUB. In particular, an action masking (AM) technique that does not alter the SD3 ' s underlying principles is proposed to prevent the SD3-based strategy from outputting invalid actions that violate the system's physical constraints. Additionally, the transfer learning (TL) method of the SD3-based strategy is explored to avoid repetitive training of neural networks in different driving cycles. The results demonstrate that the learning performance and learning stability of SD3 are unaffected by AM and that SD3 with AM achieves control performance that is highly comparable to dynamic planning for both the CHTC-B and WVUCITY driving cycles. Aside from that, TL contributes to the rapid development of SD3. TL can speed up SD3's convergence by at least 67.61% without significantly affecting fuel economy.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1				1996-1073										Guangxi Univ, Coll Mech Engn, Nanning 530004, Peoples R ChinaGuangxi Yuchai Machinery Co Ltd, Yulin 537000, Peoples R China	Guangxi Yuchai Machinery Co Ltd			2022-09-04	WOS:000845977800001

A remedy to shift the extra charging loads at peak hours to off-peak hours, caused by charging EVs at public charging stations, is an online pricing strategy. This paper presents a novel combinatorial online pricing strategy that has been established upon a reward-based model to prevent network instability and power outages. In the proposed solution, the utility provides incentives to the charging stations for their contributions in the EVs charging load shifting. Then, a constraint optimization problem is developed to minimize the total charging demand of the EVs during peak hours. To control the EVs charging demands in supporting utility's stability and increasing the total revenue of the charging stations, treated as a multi-agent framework, an online reinforcement learning model is developed which is based on the combination of an adaptive heuristic critic and recursive least square algorithm. The effective performance of the proposed model is validated through extensive simulation studies such as qualitative, numerical, and robustness performance assessment tests. The simulation results indicate significant improvement in the robustness and effectiveness of the proposed solution in terms of utility's power saving and charging stations' profit.									29	0	0	0	0	0	29			2169-3536											Deakin Univ, Sch Informat Technol, Geelong, Vic 3220, AustraliaMurdoch Univ, Coll Sci Hlth Engn & Educ, Perth, WA 6150, Australia				2020-08-12	WOS:000553983100001

The recent advances in Deep Learning technologies have made the exploitation of visual tracking approaches effective and possible in a wide variety of applications, ranging from automotive to surveillance and human assistance. However, the majority of the existing works focus exclusively on passive visual tracking, i.e., tracking elements in sequences of images by assuming that no actions can be taken to adapt the camera position to the motion of the tracked entity. On the contrary, in this work, we address visual active tracking, in which the tracker has to actively search for and track a specified target. Current State-of-the-Art approaches use Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) techniques to address the problem in an end-to-end manner. However, two main problems arise: (i) most of the contributions focus only on discrete action spaces, and the ones that consider continuous control do not achieve the same level of performance; and (ii) if not properly tuned, DRL models can be challenging to train, resulting in considerably slow learning progress and poor final performance. To address these challenges, we propose a novel DRL-based visual active tracking system that provides continuous action policies. To accelerate training and improve the overall performance, we introduce additional objective functions and a Heuristic Trajectory Generator (HTG) to facilitate learning. Through extensive experimentation, we show that our method can reach and surpass other State-of-the-Art approaches performances, and demonstrate that, even if trained exclusively in simulation, it can successfully perform visual active tracking even in real scenarios.

Dual Balancing of SoC/SoT in Smart Batteries Using Reinforcement Learning in Uppaal Stratego								IECON 2023- 49th Annual Conference of the IEEE Industrial Electronics Society								1	6				10.1109/IECON51785.2023.10311828							Conference Paper	2023	2023	Battery packs in electric vehicles are managed by battery management systems that influence the state of charge among the cells in the pack, where such systems have received much attention in research. More recently, balancing the temperature among the cells has become a research topic. In our work, we consider a dual-balancing problem where we aim to balance both the parameters of the state of charge and temperature. We consider a Smart Battery Pack, where individual cells can be bypassed, meaning that no current is going to or from the cell, which allows the cell to cool off while the cell does not charge or discharge. Moreover, a smart battery pack can estimate each cell's characteristics, which, in turn, can be used to define a model of cell and battery pack behavior. We conduct experiments using the model of a battery pack where each cell differs in its configuration as an effect of aging. For such a pack with heterogeneous cells, we use Q- Learning in U ppaal Stratego to synthesize a controller that maximizes the time spent in a balanced state, meaning that all cells' states are within a specific range of each other. We show significant improvements in two aspects compared with two threshold-based controllers that balance either state of charge or temperature. The synthesized controllers are only unbalanced with the state of charge between 1-4% of the time and for temperature between 15-20% of the time. The threshold-based controllers are either unbalanced for the state of charge for as much as 37 % of the time or for temperature for as much as 44 % of the time. Finally, the maximum variations of state of charge and temperature among the cells are decreased.

This implies a significant complexity for the system engineer to design, model, validate the system, and optimize the cycle time, including considering unexpected events at run-time. This paper addresses this challenge by describing a model-driven engineering approach that formally designs the system under the consideration of uncertainties and at run-time optimizes the system actions using learning-based approaches. We implemented this approach in an industrial-inspired case study of a spot-welding multi-robot cell. Based on the system requirements, we generate valid system strategies that consider unexpected events such as robot interruptions and failures. Considering movement and interruption time models, we implemented a reinforcement learning method to optimize system actions at run-time. We show that via simulations and learning, our approach can be used to synthesize time-efficient schedules for robot task assignments that improve the overall cycle time.					2023 IEEE 28th International Conference on Emerging Technologies and Factory Automation (ETFA)2023 IEEE 28th International Conference on Emerging Technologies and Factory Automation (ETFA)	20232023		Sinaia, RomaniaSinaia, Romania	0	0	0	0	0	0	0					979-8-3503-3991-8									Inst. of Data Sci., Leibniz Univ. of Hanover, Hannover, GermanyInst. for Software Eng., FHDW Hanover, Hannover, GermanyISW, Univ. of Stuttgart, Stuttgart, Germany				2023-10-26	INSPEC:23866811

However, a simple transfer of good practices from the automotive industry combined with experiences from agile development on a team level is not possible due to fundamental differences stemming from the particular domain specifics - i.e. different types of products and components (material versus immaterial goods), knowledge work versus production systems as well as established business models. Especially team empowerment and the absence of a a hierarchical control on all levels impacts goal orientation and business optimization. In such settings, the design of adequate incentive schemes in order to align local optimization and opportunistic behavior with the overall strategy of the company is a crucial activity of central importance.Following an agent-based simulation approach with reinforcement learning, we (i) address the question of how information regarding backlog item dependencies is shared within and in between development teams on the product level subject to different incentive schemes. We (ii) compare different incentive schemes ranging from individual to team-based compensation. Based on our results, we are (iii) able to provide recommendations on how to design such incentives, what their effect is, and how to chose an adequate development structure to foster overall software product development flow by means of more economic decisions and thus resulting in a shorter time to market. For calibrating our simulation, we rely on practical experience from a very large software company piloting and implementing lean and agile for about three years.					6th International Conference on Evaluation of Novel Approaches to Software Engineering (ENASE)6th International Conference on Evaluation of Novel Approaches to Software Engineering (ENASE)	JUN 08-11, 2011JUN 08-11, 2011	Beijing Jiaotong UnivBeijing Jiaotong Univ	Beijing Jiaotong Univ, Beijing, PEOPLES R CHINABeijing Jiaotong Univ, Beijing, PEOPLES R CHINA	0	0	0	0	0	0	0					978-989-8425-57-7									SAP AG, Dietmar Hopp Allee 16, Walldolf, GermanyRes Ctr Informat Technol, Karlsruhe, Germany	Res Ctr Informat Technol			2011-01-01	WOS:000391897000003

The new energy management strategy (EMS) needs to fuse both the physic and cyber systems, reflecting the dynamic vehicle system in the physical layer, as well as taking full advantage of the outside information in the cyber layer. Given that, this article proposes the cyber-physical system (CPS)-based EMS using deep reinforcement learning (DRL) in two different types of vehicles [hybrid electric bus (HEB) and Prius]. Under the proposed framework, exploratory training is carried out for the EMS which is mediated by DRL algorithms, expert prior knowledge and multistate of traffic information. Then, the prior valid knowledge trained by HEB is applied to Prius based on deep transfer learning, accelerating the new EMS convergence and ensuring the same initial parameters of the two vehicles' deep neural networks. Moreover, the cyber information is decoupled from the vehicle itself, for the first time being visualized for comparative analysis. The results show a significant improvement by considering traffic states (TS) and using dynamic programming (DP) as a benchmark with 6.94% fuel economy improvement for deep deterministic policy gradients (DDPG) test results and 8.12% for deep Q-learning (DQL), respectively. The decoupling analysis distinguished the effect of various TS for the HEB and Prius due to their different characteristics in vehicle service, driving style, and vehicle structures, which further verifies the effectiveness of the proposed EMS.									35	1	0	0	0	0	35			2332-7782											Beijing Inst Technol, Sch Mech Engn, Beijing 100081, Peoples R China				2021-09-03	WOS:000686895100021

According to the information of an intelligent transportation system, a method combining reinforcement learning with receding horizon optimization is proposed at the upper level, which solves the cruising velocity for eco-driving in a long predictive horizon based on the online construction of a velocity planning problem. At the lower level, a multi-objective optimal torque allocation method that considers energy saving and safety is proposed, where an analytical solution based on the state feedback control was obtained with the vehicle following the optimal speed of the upper level and tracking the centerline of the target path. The energy management strategy proposed in this study effectively reduces the complexity of the intelligent energy-saving control system of the vehicle and achieves a fast solution to the whole vehicle energy optimization problem, integrating macro-traffic information while considering both power and safety. Finally, an intelligent, connected hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) simulation platform is built to verify the method formulated in this study. The simulation results demonstrate that the proposed method reduces energy consumption by 12.98% compared with the conventional constant-speed cruising strategy. In addition, the computational time is significantly reduced.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2				2079-9292										Jilin Univ, State Key Lab Automot Simulat & Control, Changchun 130012, Peoples R ChinaChangchun Univ Technol, Sch Elect & Elect Engn, Changchun 130012, Peoples R China				2023-04-14	WOS:000958895100001

The technology to accomplish this ambition has evolved rapidly over the last few years, and yet there are still a lot of algorithmical challenges left to make an automation of the driving task a safe and comfortable experience. One of the main remaining challenges is the comprehension of the current traffic situation and the anticipation of all traffic participants' future driving behavior, which is needed for the technical system to obtain situation awareness: an indispensable foundation for successful decision-making. In this paper, a prediction framework is presented that is able to infer a driver's maneuver intention. This is achieved via a hybrid Bayesian network whose hidden layers represent a driver's lane contentedness. A pre-training of the network's parameters with simulated data provides for human interpretable parameters even after running the expectation maximization algorithm based on data gathered on German highways. Moreover, the future driving path of any traffic participant is predicted by solving an optimal control problem, whereby the parameters of the optimal control formulation are found via inverse reinforcement learning.									20	3	0	0	0	0	23			2379-8858	2379-8904										BMW AG, Res & Dev, D-80788 Munich, GermanyUniv Duisburg Essen, Fak Ingn Wissensch, Lehrstuhl Mechatron, D-47048 Duisburg, Germany				2019-06-01	WOS:000722394100009

Herein, a power-split HEV model is built and validated against test results, and then the EMS is proposed for this model based on vehicle speed prediction and deep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithms. The rule-based local controller and global optimal empirical knowledge are introduced to enhance the convergence speed. It is shown in the results that the twin delayed deep deterministic policy gradient algorithm (TD3) achieves more satisfactory performance on converge speed and energy efficiency. The networks of the DRL algorithm with continuous control update more robustly during iterations, in contrast to the discrete ones. Although the power-split HEV with lower control dimension can reduce the learning burden for DRL EMS; however, the multidimensional control space shows greater optimization potential. As a result, the equivalent fuel consumption of TD3-based EMS with multidimensional continuous control differences from the global optimal algorithm only by 4.92%. Herein, it is demonstrated in the results that long short-term memory recurrent neural network (LSTM RNN) performs better for vehicle speed prediction than classical RNN and BP neural network, and the predictive vehicle speed feature helps improve fuel economy by 0.55%.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			2194-4288	2194-4296										Xi An Jiao Tong Univ, Sch Energy & Power Engn, Xian 710049, Peoples R China				2023-06-08	WOS:000993743200001

We propose a new architecture for behavioural planning of vehicles, that decide their motion taking high-level decisions, such as "keep lane", "overtake" and "go to rightmost lane". This is similar to a driver's high-level reasoning and takes into account the availability of ever more sophisticated Advanced Driving Assistance Systems (ADAS) in current vehicles. Compared to a low-level decision making system, our model performs better both in terms of safety and average speed. As a significant advantage, the hierarchical approach allows to reduce the number of training steps, which is critical for ML models, by more than one order of magnitude. The developed agent seems to show a more realistic behaviour. We also showed feasibility of training models able to differentiate their performance in a way similar to the driving styles. We believe that such agents could be profitably employed in state of the art SGs for driving, improving the realism of single NPVs and overall traffic.					11th International Conference on Games and Learning Alliance (GaLA)11th International Conference on Games and Learning Alliance (GaLA)	NOV 30-DEC 02, 2022NOV 30-DEC 02, 2022	Serious Games SocSerious Games Soc	Tampere, FINLANDTampere, FINLAND	0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0302-9743	1611-3349	978-3-031-22123-1; 978-3-031-22124-8									Univ Genoa, Dept Elect Elect & Telecommun Engn DITEN, Via Opera Pia 11A, I-16145 Genoa, Italy				2023-02-19	WOS:000922049800022

Hybrid classical-quantum algorithms have potential, however, to achieve good performance on much larger problem instances. One such hybrid algorithm on a problem of substantial importance: vehicle routing for supply chain logistics with multiple trucks and complex demand structure is investigated. Reinforcement learning with neural networks with embedded quantum circuits is used. In such neural networks, projecting high-dimensional feature vectors down to smaller vectors is necessary to accommodate restrictions on the number of qubits of NISQ hardware. However, a multi-head attention mechanism is used where, even in classical machine learning, such projections are natural and desirable. Data from the truck routing logistics of a company in the automotive sector is considered, and the methodology is applied by decomposing into small teams of trucks and results are found comparable to human truck assignment.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0				2511-9044										QC Ware Corp, 195 Page Mill Rd,Suite 113, Palo Alto, CA 94306 USAAISIN Corp, Tokyo Res Ctr, 1-18-13 Sotokanda,Chiyoda Ku, Tokyo 1010021, JapanAisin Tech Ctr Amer, 2055 Gateway Pl,Suite 410, San Jose, CA 95110 USA	QC Ware CorpAISIN CorpAisin Tech Ctr Amer			2023-06-07	WOS:000991449600001

With the advent of military science, combat logs became available, allowing machine learning algorithms to be used for the behavior optimization. Due to implicit attributes such as the experience of an operator that are not explicitly presented in log data, existing methods for behavior optimization have limitations in performance improvement. Furthermore, specific behaviors occur with low frequency, resulting in a dataset with imbalanced and empty values. Therefore, we apply a matrix factorization (MF) method, which is one of latent factor models and known for sophisticated imputation of empty values, to the behavior optimization problem of unmanned combat aerial vehicles. A situation-behavior matrix, whose elements are ratings indicating the optimality of behaviors in situations, is defined to implement the MF based method. Experiments for performance comparison were conducted on combat logs, in which the proposed method yielded satisfactory results.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2169-3536											Korea Polytech Univ, Dept Business Adm, Siheung Si 15073, South KoreaSeoul Natl Univ, Dept Ind Engn & Inst Ind Syst Innovat, Seoul 08826, South KoreaHanyang Univ, Dept Ind & Management Engn, Ansan 15588, South KoreaKyonggi Univ, Dept Ind & Management Engn, Suwon 16227, South Korea				2020-07-09	WOS:000541127800111

Given that, this article proposes a naturalistic data-driven and emission reduction-conscious EMS based on deep reinforcement learning (DRL) for a power-split HEV. In this article, for the purpose of evaluating the practical fuel economy of an HEV driving in a certain city region, a specific driving cycle is constructed by using a naturalistic data-driven method. Furthermore, to realize the multi-objective optimization in terms of fuel conservation and emission reduction as well as the state of charge (SOC) sustaining, an intelligent EMS based on the improved soft actor-critic (SAC) algorithm with a novel experience replay method is innovatively proposed. Finally, the effectiveness and optimality of the proposed EMS are verified. Simulation results indicate that the constructed driving cycle can effectively reflect the real traffic scenarios of the test region. Moreover, the proposed EMS achieves 95.25% fuel economy performance of the global optimum, improving the fuel economy by 5.29% and reducing the emissions by 10.42% compared with the emission reduction-neglecting EMS based on standard SAC. This article contributes to energy conservation and emission reduction for the transportation industry through advanced DRL methods.									7	0	0	0	0	0	7			0378-7753	1873-2755										Beijing Inst Technol, Natl Engn Res Ctr Elect Vehicles, Beijing 100081, Peoples R ChinaBeijing Inst Technol, Collaborat Innovat Ctr Elect Vehicles Beijing, Beijing 100081, Peoples R ChinaBeijing Inst Technol, Sch Mech Engn, Beijing 100081, Peoples R China				2023-04-19	WOS:000960741600001

Advanced battery technology has been exploited in electric vehicle application and has made considerable progress. However, the degradation of batteries in the vehicle operation could cause adverse effects on the performance and lifespan of electric vehicles. Research on battery/supercapacitor hybrid energy storage systems of electric vehicles that considers energy saving and battery degradation is also lacking. This paper presents a fast Q-learning based energy management strategy to maximize energy saving and minimize battery degradation. Besides, battery only electric vehicle is also studied, and acts as a baseline vehicle. An electrified powertrain system model considering the battery degradation effect is established to form the environment for the Q-learning strategy.

Since it is a complex procedure that requires an adequate system, the recent trend consists in outsourcing RL to third-party reverse logistics providers (3PRLPs). This paper provides the background of sustainable triple bottom line theory with focus on economic, environmental, and social aspects under 3PRL concerns. The relevant sustainability criteria are used in a case study conducted in cooperation with an Indian automotive remanufacturing company. To select the most preferred service provider, we use a hybrid method combining a variant of ELECTRE I accounting for the effect of reinforced preference, the revised Simos procedure, and Stochastic Multi-criteria Acceptability Analysis. The incorporated approach exploits all parameters of an outranking model compatible with the incomplete preference information of the Decision Maker. In particular, it derives the newly defined kernel acceptability and membership indices that can be interpreted as a support given to the selection of either a particular subset of alternatives or a single option. The proposed ELECTRE-based method enriches the spectrum of multiple criteria decision analysis approaches that can be used to effectively approach the problem of the 3PRLP selection. As indicated by the extensive review presented in the paper, this application field was so far dominated by Analytic Hierarchy Process and TOPSIS, whose weaknesses can be overcome by applying the outranking methods.

Traditional distance-based testing has been shown to be expensive and time-consuming. To address this, experts have proposed scenario-based testing (SBT), which simulates detailed real-world driving scenarios to assess vehicle responses efficiently. This paper introduces a method that builds a parametric representation of a driving scenario using collected driving data. By adopting a data-driven approach, we are then able to generate realistic, concrete scenarios that correspond to high-risk situations. A reinforcement learning technique is used to identify the combination of parameter values that result in the failure of a system under test (SUT). The proposed method generates novel, simulated high-risk scenarios, thereby offering a meaningful and focused assessment of AV systems.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0				1424-8220										Emerging Technol, IAG, Sydney, NSW 2000, AustraliaUniv Sydney, Australian Ctr Field Robot, Chippendale, NSW 2008, Australia	Emerging Technol			2024-01-29	WOS:001140373000001	38202970

This system provides electric power to EVs on the point of stopping. A scheme of sensorless positioning system in SDWPT system via magnetic resonance coupling is proposed in this paper. High transmission efficiency and short vehicular gap position are selected as the final stop position which lead to energy conservation and traffic jam problem reduction. These proposed methods also show more practicality of positioning system for SDWPT system by using command value prediction (CVP) and reinforcement learning algorithm (RLA).

Despite the popularity of AI-enabled CPS, few benchmarks are publicly available. There is also a lack of deep understanding on the performance and reliability of AI-enabled CPS across different industrial domains. To bridge this gap, we present a public benchmark of industry-level CPS in seven domains and build AI controllers for them via state-of-the-art deep reinforcement learning (DRL) methods. Based on that, we further perform a systematic evaluation of these AI-enabled systems with their traditional counterparts to identify current challenges and future opportunities.

For the enterprises with daily delivered production tasks, the random job arrivals are regular. Thus, the Distributed Job-shop Scheduling Problem (DJSP) with random job arrivals is studied, and it is a typical case from the equipment manufacturing industry. The DJSP involves two coupled decision-making processes, job assigning and job sequencing, and the distributed and uncertain pro-duction environment requires the scheduling method to be more responsive and adaptive. Thus, a Deep Rein-forcement Learning (DRL) based multi-agent method is explored, and it is composed of the assigning agent and the sequencing agent. Two Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) are formulated for the two agents respectively. In the MDP for the assigning agent, fourteen factory-and-job related features are extracted as the state features, seven composite assigning rules are designed as the candidate actions, and the reward depends on the total processing time of different factories. In the MDP of the sequencing agent, five machine-and-job related features are set as the state features, six sequencing rules make up the action space, and the change of the factory makespan is the reward. Besides, to enhance the learning ability of the agents, a Deep Q-Network (DQN) framework with variable threshold probability in the training stage is designed, which can balance the exploi-tation and exploration in the model training. The proposed multi-agent method's effectiveness is proved by the independent utility test and the comparison test that are based on 1350 production instances, and its practical value in the actual production is implied by the case study from an automotive engine manufacturing company.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			0360-8352	1879-0550										Huazhong Univ Sci & Technol, State Key Lab Digital Mfg Equipment & Technol, Wuhan 430074, Peoples R China				2023-11-15	WOS:001095511300001

However, the tremendous amount of transmitted vehicular sensor data represents a massive challenge for the cellular network. A promising method for achieving relief which allows to utilize the existing network resources in a more efficient way is the utilization of intelligence on the end-edge-cloud devices. Through machine learning-based identification and exploitation of highly resource efficient data transmission opportunities, the client devices are able to participate in overall network resource optimization process. In this work, we present a novel client-based opportunistic data transmission method for delay-tolerant applications which is based on a hybrid machine learning approach: Supervised learning is applied to forecast the currently achievable data rate which serves as the metric for the reinforcement learning-based data transfer scheduling process. In addition, unsupervised learning is applied to uncover geospatially-dependent uncertainties within the prediction model. In a comprehensive real world evaluation in the public cellular networks of three German Mobile Network Operator (MNO), we show that the average data rate can be improved by up to 223% while simultaneously reducing the amount of occupied network resources by up to 89%. As a side-effect of preferring more robust network conditions for the data transfer, the transmission-related power consumption is reduced by up to 73%. The price to pay is an increased Age of Information (AoI) of the sensor data.									18	0	0	0	0	0	18			0018-9545	1939-9359										TU Dortmund Univ, Commun Networks Inst, D-44227 Dortmund, Germany				2021-06-01	WOS:000671544000014

While 5G/6G vehicular edge computing networks (VECNs) offer potential solutions through computation task offloading, ensuring prompt, energy-efficient access to these networks remains a significant challenge. To overcome these challenges, reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RIS) can play an important role in 6G vehicular networks. With RIS, networks can provide better connectivity, increased data rate and energy efficient access, and communication channel security. In this paper, we utilize zero-energy RIS (ze-RIS) to aid vehicular computation offloading while maximizing the energy and time savings while meeting the task and environmental constraints. A joint power and offloading mechanism controlling DRL-driven RIS-assisted energy efficient task offloading (DREEO) scheme is proposed. DREEO utilizes a hybrid approach that combines binary and partial offloading mechanisms, complemented by an intelligent communication link switching mechanism. This strategy helps in saving both energy and time effectively. An efficiency factor, serving as both a performance indicator and a reward function, is introduced for the DRL agent, considering both saved energy and time. Through extensive evaluations, DREEO scheme shown an increase in task success rate from 2.13% to 7.36% and has improved the efficiency factor from 21.97 to 51.27. Furthermore, compared to other evaluated schemes, the DREEO scheme consistently outperforms them in terms of reward and the TFPS ratio, the DRL properties.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1319-1578	2213-1248										Beijing Univ Posts & Telecommun BUPT, QMUL EM Theory & Applicat Int Res Lab, Beijing 100876, Peoples R ChinaAnhui Normal Univ, Sch Phys & Elect Informat, Wuhu 241003, Peoples R ChinaLuoyang Vocat Coll Sci & Technol, Sch Intelligence & Digital Engn, Luoyang 471000, Peoples R ChinaHubei Engn Univ, Inst AI Ind Technol Res, Sch Comp & Informat Sci, Xiaogan 432000, Peoples R ChinaNatl Text Univ, Dept Comp Sci, Faisalabad, PakistanUniv Luxembourg, Interdisciplinary Ctr Secur Reliabil & Trust SnT, L-1855 Luxembourg, LuxembourgYeungnam Univ, Dept Informat & Commun Engn, Gyongsan, South KoreaSuper Univ, Dept Comp Sci, Lahore, Pakistan	Beijing Univ Posts & Telecommun BUPTLuoyang Vocat Coll Sci & TechnolSuper Univ			2024-02-20	WOS:001125503400001

Owing to economic, environmental and social benefits, RSC has been adopted to many industries and automotive is no exception. Multiple components and materials found in End-of-life vehicles (ELVs) have potential recycling value but also cause environmental damages if improperly treated. The number of ELVs is accelerating worldwide, especially in developing countries. Research on RSCs for ELVs treatment has been increasing. However, the literature still lacks a comprehensive understanding of this topic. The authors thus conducted an in-depth content review of publications on RSC of ELVs. The methodology applied PRISMA 2020 guideline combined with the model of Mayring (2001). Extensive search strings were utilized to retrieve articles from SCOPUS and Web of Science. After a rigid selection process and an intensive content assessment on 10,140 publications as raw materials, a total of 151 peer-reviewed papers was selected and carefully analyzed. The content categories were developed deductively and inductively. Major categories included research methodology overarching others: research themes, RSC/ELV types, stages in RSC, country specific and stakeholders. Modeling is the most commonly used among the papers, especially in RSC network design and planning. Mixed-integer linear programming prevails over other modeling approaches while AHP is predominant decision-making tool. Studies on legislations, network performance evaluation, and forecasting remain negligible. Categorization and significant achievements of articles are introduced. Future research is suggested upon identified research gaps. The review benefits academicians and practitioners in better comprehension of the field and promising research directions.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			2667-3789											Ritsumeikan Asia Pacific Univ, Grad Sch Asia Pacific Studies, 1-1 Jumonjibaru, Beppu, Oita 8748577, JapanRitsumeikan Asia Pacific Univ, Coll Asia Pacific Studies, 1-1 Jumonjibaru, Beppu, Oita 8748577, Japan				2023-11-19	WOS:001092688800001

As Artificial Intelligence (AI) has demonstrated its promising abilities in diverse tasks like decision-making, prediction, and optimization, a growing number of CPSs adopt AI components in the loop to further extend their efficiency and performance. However, these modern AI-enabled CPSs have to tackle pivotal problems that the AI-enabled control systems might need to compensate the balance across multiple operation requirements and avoid possible defections in advance to safeguard human lives and properties. Modular redundancy and ensemble method are two widely adopted solutions in the traditional CPSs and AI communities to enhance the functionality and flexibility of a system. Nevertheless, there is a lack of deep understanding of the effectiveness of such ensemble design on AI-CPSs across diverse industrial applications. Considering the complexity of AI-CPSs, existing ensemble methods fall short of handling such huge state space and sophisticated system dynamics. Furthermore, an ideal control solution should consider the multiple system specifications in real-time and avoid erroneous behaviors beforehand. Such that, a new specification-oriented ensemble control system is of urgent need for AI-CPSs. In this paper, we propose SIEGE, a semantics-guided ensemble control framework to initiate an early exploratory study of ensemble methods on AI-CPSs and aim to construct an efficient, robust, and reliable control solution for multi-tasks AI-CPSs. We first utilize a semantic-based abstraction to decompose the large state space, capture the ongoing system status and predict future conditions in terms of the satisfaction of specifications. We propose a series of new semantics-aware ensemble strategies and an end-to-end Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) hierarchical ensemble method to improve the flexibility and reliability of the control systems. Our large-scale, comprehensive evaluations over five subject CPSs show that 1) the semantics abstraction can efficiently narrow the large state space and predict the semantics of incoming states, 2) our semantics-guided methods outperform state-of-the-art individual controllers and traditional ensemble methods, and 3) the DRL hierarchical ensemble approach shows promising capabilities to deliver a more robust, efficient, and safety-assured control system. To enable further research along this direction to build better AI-enabled CPS, we made all of the code and experimental results data publicly (https://sites.google.com/view/ai-cps-siege/ home).									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0098-5589	1939-3520										Univ Alberta, Edmonton, AB T6G 2R3, CanadaUniv Tokyo, Tokyo 1138654, Japan				2023-09-03	WOS:001049968200007		
J	Zhang, Yuanzhi; Zhang, Caizhi; Fan, Ruijia; Deng, Chenghao; Wan, Song; Chaoui, Hicham										Energy management strategy for fuel cell vehicles via soft actor-critic-based deep reinforcement learning considering powertrain thermal and durability characteristics								ENERGY CONVERSION AND MANAGEMENT				283						116921			10.1016/j.enconman.2023.116921					MAR 2023		Article; Early Access		2023	Temperature can significantly affect the water equilibrium, electrochemical kinetics and mass transmission in a proton exchange membrane fuel cell (PEMFC) stack, meanwhile it also impacts the lifespan and safety of a lithium-ion battery (LIB). Yet, energy management strategy (EMS) is rarely to synchronously study the durability performances of the LIB and PEMFC stack with their thermal effects in fuel cell vehicles (FCVs) under real-world driving scenarios. Thus, this study proposes a deep reinforcement learning (DRL)-based EMS to minimize tran-sient costs of the LIB and PEMFC stack, which include their state-of-health (SOH) descents and overtemperature penalties. Meanwhile, the transient costs are incorporated into the overall cost, which comprises the hydrogen consumption rate of the PEMFC stack, and penalty of maintaining the LIB state-of-charge (SOC). Moreover, the soft actor-critic (SAC) is applied to the DRL-based EMS due to its advantage of stability across different random environments and no meticulous hyperparameter calibration. Specifically, the proposed EMS intelligently allo-cates the direct current (DC) bus power of FCVs in real time to maximize a multi-objective reward in accordance with FCV states, in which the reward is the negative overall cost. Then, long-term real-world driving scenarios in Chongqing city, China, are used for off-line training and real-time control to advance the adaptability of the proposed EMS. The results show that in comparison with the deep Q-network (DQN)-based EMS considering the powertrain temperature and durability, and the SAC-based EMS neglecting the powertrain temperature and durability, the proposed strategy can actualize overall SOH increments of the powertrain up to 14.01 % and 3.45 %, respectively, and restrict the maximum temperatures of the PEMFC stack and LIB. In addition, the general-ization of the proposed EMS is verified, in which the trained model of the proposed EMS is tested in other FCV and driving cycles, and it can acquire similar effectiveness. Thus, the proposed strategy can enforce the lifespan durability and thermal stability of the powertrain system.									11	0	0	0	0	0	11			0196-8904	1879-2227										Chongqing Univ, Coll Mech & Vehicle Engn, Chongqing Automot Collaborat Innovat Ctr, State Key Lab Mech Transmiss, Chongqing 400044, Peoples R ChinaTongji Univ, Clean Energy Automot Engn Ctr, Sch Automot Studies, Shanghai 201804, Peoples R ChinaChongqing Changan New Energy Vehicle Technol Co Lt, Chongqing, Peoples R ChinaCarleton Univ, Dept Elect, Ottawa, ON K1S 5B6, CanadaTexas Tech Univ, Dept Elect & Comp Engn, Lubbock, TX 79409 USA	Chongqing Changan New Energy Vehicle Technol Co Lt			2023-04-12	WOS:000959453900001

The high power-to-energy ratio in these power supply systems makes exact voltage prediction challenging, so that a method is established to model the behavior of the lithium-ion batteries by means of a recurrent neural network. The raw data are consequently pre-processed with over- and undersampling, normalization and sequentialization algorithms. The resulting database is used to train the constructed recurrent neural network models, while hyperparameter tuning is carried out with the optimization framework optuna. This training methodology is performed with two battery types. Validation shows a maximum error of 2.34 V for the LTO battery and a maximum error of 3.39 V for the LFP battery.

The method utilizes model-free generation and coordinated control of multiple converters, and employs a combination of agent modeling and multi-agent soft actor critic (MASAC) techniques for modeling and solving the problem. Firstly, a complex nonlinear mapping relationship between bus power and voltage is established by training an power-voltage model, to address the issue of obtaining physical parameters in AC/DC distribution networks. Next, a Markov decision process is established for the voltage control problem, with multiple intelligent agents distributed to control the active and reactive power at each converter, in response to the uncertainties of photovoltaic (PV) and load variations. Using the MASAC method, a centralized training strategy and decentralized execution policy are implemented to achieve distributed control of the converters, with each converter making optimal decisions based on its local observation state. Finally, the proposed method is verified by numerical simulations, demonstrating its sound effectiveness and generalization ability.

Therefore, autonomous driving systems in the automotive field represent a major trend in the future of intelligent transportation systems. This paper focuses on the application of Q-learning and deep neural networks in autonomous driving systems. The simulation in Python is used to simulate the condition of the car driving alone on the road. Firstly, the normal car driving situation was analyzed and the actions and states in Q-learning were set. The action set-up ensures the distance sensors' number and direction. Then, this paper draws the neural network and simulates it to get the data. Secondly, it analyzes the resulting reward scores and iteration times and identifies uncertainties through line graphs. In addition, it observes the simulation video and derives the reasons why uncertainty appears. In the simulation, the Best Score, Average generation time and Genetic distance were obtained from the simulation against the number of Gens. The data for genetic distance was found to increase with the number of times it was generated, indicating that the Q-learning component was successfully run in the simulation. And it was found that the uncertainty was due to the birth point of the vehicle. According to the uncertainty, further development of the simulation could include more road environments and different obstacles.					2023 2nd International Conference on Data Analytics, Computing and Artificial Intelligence (ICDACAI)2023 2nd International Conference on Data Analytics, Computing and Artificial Intelligence (ICDACAI)	20232023		Zakopane, PolandZakopane, Poland	0	0	0	0	0	0	0					979-8-3503-3976-5									Mech.

Chong, J.J.; Truong Quang Dinh				Failure safety analysis of artificial intelligence systems for smart/autonomous vehicles								2021 24th International Conference on Mechatronics Technology (ICMT)								6 pp.	6 pp.				10.1109/ICMT53429.2021.9687283							Conference Paper	2021	2021	Up to now failures in artificial intelligence systems, specifically machine learning algorithms which are their software components, are considered as systematic failures. The goal of this paper is to introduce a new concept of quantitative failure analysis for machine learning algorithms which can be used in smart/autonomous vehicles to guarantee sufficiently low risk of residual errors in this application. Firstly, a coincidence in evaluating impacts of unpredictable behaviours of machine learning algorithms and hardware components is introduced in order to statistically estimate failure rate based on a given number of data points. Next, a metric utilising this randomic failure rate is proposed to assess functional safety of smart and/or autonomous vehicles and evaluate their safeness according to ISO 26262:2018, and ISO/PAS 21448.					2021 24th International Conference on Mechatronics Technology (ICMT)2021 24th International Conference on Mechatronics Technology (ICMT)	18-22 Dec. 202118-22 Dec. 2021	Newcastle University; University of Warwick; IEEENewcastle University; University of Warwick; IEEE	Virtual Conference, SingaporeVirtual Conference, Singapore	0	0	0	0	0	0	0					978-1-6654-2459-2									WMG, Univ.of Warwick, Coventry, UKMarelli Emanuele II, Italy				2022-11-01	INSPEC:21703696

Our recently published research in this journal verified the effectiveness and feasibility of a Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG)-based EMS in the charge-sustaining (CS) stage of a multi-mode plug-in hybrid vehicle (PHEV). However, the application of ML-based-EMS in the charge-depletion (CD) stage and the regenerative braking mode of PHEV are still missing. This study proposes a discrete-continuous hybrid actions-based hier-archical EMS to optimally distribute the dual-motor driving force in battery electric driving and regenerative braking. In the upper layer of EMS, DDPG is trained to learn the torque distribution principles of dual-motor operation to achieve better energy efficiency without losing dynamic performance. Meanwhile, the total recoverable braking torque is also determined by the upper layer EMS considering the braking demand, me-chanical and electrical braking system conditions, vehicle safety, and the provisions of law. In the lower level of EMS, the driving mode is determined under the guidance of energy consumption optimization. The verified results show that the proposed EMS outperforms other deep reinforcement learning (DRL)-based hierarchical and non-hierarchical EMSs.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			0360-5442	1873-6785										Beijing Univ Technol, Coll Intelligent Machinery, Dept Mat & Mfg, Beijing 100020, Peoples R ChinaBeijing Inst Technol, Sch Mech Engn, Beijing 100081, Peoples R ChinaBeijing Foton AUV New Energy Bus Co Ltd, Beijing 102200, Peoples R ChinaChangan Univ, Sch Automobile, Xian 710021, Shaanxi, Peoples R ChinaRhein Westfal TH Aachen, Inst Power Elect & Elect Drives ISEA, Jaegerstr 17-19, D-52066 Aachen, Germany	Beijing Foton AUV New Energy Bus Co Ltd			2023-02-23	WOS:000924837800001

To solve this problem, a novel energy-efficient Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient-based (DDPG) Algorithm, able to minimize its energy consumption while guaranteeing the optimal tracking of the suggested path, is proposed. Specifically, in order to improve the power autonomy and the battery state of charge (SOC), a Comprehensive Power-based Electric Vehicle Consumption Model (CPEM) is exploited for the training of the DDPG agent. The training process confirms the capability of DDPG agent into learning the safe eco-driving policy, while a case of study proves the advantages and the performance of the overall closed-loop of the proposed control strategy.					2023 IEEE IAS Global Conference on Renewable Energy and Hydrogen Technologies (GlobConHT)2023 IEEE IAS Global Conference on Renewable Energy and Hydrogen Technologies (GlobConHT)	11-12 March 202311-12 March 2023		Male, MaldivesMale, Maldives	0	0	0	0	0	0	0					979-8-3503-3211-7									DIETI, Univ. of Naples Federico II, Naples, Italy				2023-04-28	INSPEC:22929229

This article deals with the control problem of an Automatic Manual Transmission, where the actuator of the system is a double-acting floating-piston cylinder, with dedicated inner-position. During the control design of electro-pneumatic cylinders, one must implement a set-valued control on a nonlinear system, when, as in the present case, non-proportional valves provide the airflow. As both the system model itself and the qualitative control goals can be formulated as a Partially Observable Markov Decision Process, Machine learning frameworks are a conspicuous choice for handling such control problems. To this end, six different solutions are compared in the article, of which a new agent named PG-MCTS, using a modified version of the "Upper Confidence bound for Trees" algorithm, is also presented. The performance and strategic choice comparison of the six methods are carried out in a simulation environment. Validation tests performed on an actual transmission system and implemented on an automotive control unit to prove the applicability of the concept. In this case, a Policy Gradient agent, selected by implementation and computation capacity restrictions. The results show that the presented methods are suitable for the control of floating-piston cylinders and can be extended to other fluid mechanical actuators, or even different set-valued nonlinear control problems.									4	1	0	0	0	0	5			2169-3536											Budapest Univ Technol & Econ, Dept Control Transportat & Vehicle Syst, H-1111 Budapest, HungaryInst Comp Sci & Control, Syst & Control Lab, H-1111 Budapest, Hungary				2020-09-08	WOS:000562747600001

High-dynamic high-power E-Motor Emulator for power electronic testing								PCIM Europe 2018								1157	61											Conference Paper	2018	2018	In the past decade, inverter testing has become a very important and complex issue during inverter developments. State-of-the-art inverters, key components of electrical power trains, offer multiple functions, high reliability, fault tolerance and they must ensure a high level of functional safety. Especially automotive applications prove to be demanding due to their exceptionally high dynamic requirements, challenging mission profiles, harsh environment and special test cases such as the curb stone edge case with high currents, high dynamic and no speed. Conventional test methods such as motor test beds or active / passive RL-loads are not suitable to verify inverter functionalities in a sufficient manner.

C	Ulmschneider, Klaus; Glimm, Birte			IEEE							Semantic Exploitation of Implicit Patent Information								PROCEEDINGS OF 2016 IEEE SYMPOSIUM SERIES ON COMPUTATIONAL INTELLIGENCE (SSCI)																				Proceedings Paper	2016	2016	In recent years patents have become increasingly important for businesses to protect their intellectual capital and as a valuable source of information. Patent information is, however, not employed to its full potential and the interpretation of structured and unstructured patent information in large volumes remains a challenge. We address this by proposing an integrated interdisciplinary approach that uses natural language processing and machine learning techniques to formalize multilingual patent information in an ontology. The ontology further contains patent and domain specific knowledge, which allows for aligning patents with technological fields of interest and other business-related artifacts. Our empirical evaluation shows that for categorizing patents according to well-known technological fields of interest, the approach achieves high accuracy with selected feature sets compared to related work focussing on monolingual patents. We further show that combining OWL RL reasoning with SPARQL querying over the patent knowledge base allows for answering complex business queries and illustrate this with real-world use cases from the automotive domain.

The presented Coplanar Waveguide-Coplanar Waveguide-Microstrip (CPW-CPW-MSTRIP) and CPW-CPW-CPW 3D transitions require strategically placed vias and tapering of the CPW ground planes in order to suppress radiation loss and optimize the performance over a very broad frequency range. These transitions are simple to realize and are compatible with low-cost substrate fabrication guidelines allowing for the easy feeding of embedded IC's in 3D modules, especially in compact automotive radar applications and beam-steering wideband antenna arrays. To estimate the effect of practical fabrication variations, a sensitivity analysis was performed against the lateral misalignment of via to pad defined by commercial fabrication houses and shows a worst case scenario of a 5dB RL and 0.2dB IL degradation compared to the ideal case. The measurement results of the reported transitions exhibit very good performance up to 100 GHz and show reasonable agreement with simulation.

There is typically a minimum time limit reflected by a part's travel time or process requirement. Meanwhile, these intermediate parts are prevented from staying in the buffer for too long by an upper time limit, exceeding which a part will be scrapped or need additional treatment. To increase production throughput and reduce scrap, one needs to control machines' working mode according to real-time system information in the stochastic production environment, which is a difficult problem to solve, due to the system's complexity. In this article, we propose a novel decomposition-based control approach by decomposing a production system into small-scale subsystems based on domain knowledge and their structural relationship. An iterative aggregation procedure is then used to generate a production control policy with convergence guarantee. Numerical studies suggest that the decomposition-based control approach outperforms general-purpose reinforcement learning method by delivering significant system performance improvement and substantial reduction on computation overhead.									6	0	0	0	0	0	6			2472-5854	2472-5862										Arizona State Univ, Sch Comp Informat & Decis Syst Engn, Tempe, AZ 85281 USA				2020-10-15	WOS:000574679900001

Handling of giant sheet materials in manufacturing industries is one of the key problems. Utilization of robots, viz SwarmItFIX, will address this problem and automate the fixturing process, which greatly reduces lead time and thus the production cost. Implementation of intelligence into the robots will further improve efficiency in handling and reduce manufacturing inaccuracies. In this work, two different novel planners are proposed which do path planning for the heads of the SwarmItFIX agents. The environment of the problem is modeled as a Markov Decision Problem. The first planner uses the Value Iteration and Policy Iteration (PI) algorithms individually and the second planner performs the Monte Carlo control reinforcement learning. Finally, when the simulation is done and parameters of the proposed three algorithms along with existing Constraint Satisfaction Problem algorithm are compared with each other. It is observed that the proposed PI algorithm returns the plan much faster than the other algorithms. In the near future, the efficient planning model will be tested and implemented into the SwarmItFIX setup at the PMAR laboratory, University of Genoa, Italy.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			0956-5515	1572-8145										Indian Inst Informat Technol Design & Mfg Kanchee, Ctr AI IoT & Robot, Dept Mech Engn, Vandalur Kelambakkam Rd, Chennai 600127, Tamil Nadu, IndiaUniv Genoa, PMAR Robot Grp, Via All Opera Pia, I-16145 Genoa, Italy				2020-04-16	WOS:000523031700002

The electrified propulsion system improves energy efficiency and reduces the dependence on fossil fuel. However, the batteries of electric vehicles experience degradation process during vehicle operation. Research considering both battery degradation and energy consumption in battery/ultracapacitor electric vehicles is still lacking. This study proposes a Q-learning-based strategy to minimize battery degradation and energy consumption. Besides Q-learning, two rule-based energy management methods are also proposed and optimized using Particle Swarm Optimization algorithm. A vehicle propulsion system model is first presented, where the severity factor battery degradation model is considered and exper-imentally validated with the help of Genetic Algorithm. In the results analysis, Q-learning is first explained with the optimal policy map after learning. Then, the result from a vehicle without ultra-capacitor is used as the baseline, which is compared with the results from the vehicle with ultracapacitor using Q-learning, and two rule-based methods as the energy management strategies. At the learning and validation driving cycles, the results indicate that the Q-learning strategy slows down the battery degradation by 13-20% and increases the vehicle range by 1.5-2% compared with the baseline vehicle without ultracapacitor.

J											Assuring Safety and Trustworthiness of Deep Neural Networks by Making Them More Interpretable																												Awarded Grant	Sep 30 2018	2018	Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) is one of the key techniques leading to the current wave of artificial intelligence. However, the concerns on its safety and trustworthiness have been raised, particularly when it is applied to safety critical applications such as autonomous driving cars and un-manned aerial vehicles (UAVs). Additional to ensure its functional correctness, techniques are urgently needed to explain the black-box model and its decision making. An interpretable model can significantly improve human operators' trust on the DRL model. In this project, we aim to develop a set of interpretability techniques for DRL models. We will start by developing novel adversarial attacks for DRL models to study their robustness, and then investigate how to utilise the obtained adversarial examples for interpretability. The success of this project may significantly improve the safety and trustworthiness of the DRL models, and enable its wide applications to the automotive and aerospace industries in the UK.

This paper presents a brief review of the main research and innovation actions at the European level, as well as some on-going research related to sensor reliability in cyber-physical systems (CPS). The research reported in this paper is also focused on the design of a procedure for evaluating the reliability of Internet-of-Things sensors in a cyber-physical system. The results of a case study of sensor reliability assessment in an autonomous driving scenario for the automotive sector are also shown. A co-simulation framework is designed in order to enable real-time interaction between virtual and real sensors. The case study consists of an IoT LiDAR-based collaborative map in order to assess the CPS-based co-simulation framework. Specifically, the sensor chosen is the Ibeo Lux 4-layer LiDAR sensor with IoT added capabilities. The modeling library for predicting error with machine learning methods is implemented at a local level, and a self-learning-procedure for decision-making based on Q-learning runs at a global level. The study supporting the experimental evaluation of the co-simulation framework is presented using simulated and real data. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method for increasing sensor reliability in cyber-physical systems using Internet-of-Things data.									44	0	0	0	1	0	45				2072-4292										Spanish Natl Res Council, Ctr Automat & Robot CSIC UPM, Madrid 28500, SpainWarsaw Univ Technol, Fac Prod Engn, Warsaw, Poland				2019-12-06	WOS:000496827100066

J									Sarangapani,  Jagannathan		Event Triggered Unknown Networked Control System Design by using Adaptive Dynamic Programming																												Awarded Grant	Aug 01 2014	2014	This project will develop new universal control designs for Network Control Systems (NCS) such as the new distributed control systems needed for the smart grid and modern automotive systems. Unlike many traditional NCS systems, these will be designed from the start so as to maximize performance over time, fully accounting for communication delays in networks and unexpected events, as well as nonlinearities, continuous random disturbances and other issues which this PI has addressed in the past. He intends to develop rigorous mathematical proofs that these new designs will always lead to stable operation. He will also maintain a pipeline to immediate practical applications, through his existing Industry-University Center on Intelligent Maintenance. The designs are intended to be general, learning-based and massively parallel, in a way which may also help us understand how mammal brains can perform tasks beyond the scope of more traditional types of design.<br/><br/>These designs will be an extension of work previously funded by NSF, described in the Handbook of RLADP, edited by Lewis and Liu. ADP, like linear programming, is a class of challenges, not just one specific method, though there are relations between the successful methods. ADP includes all the methods aimed at the general problem of multistage optimization in the face of nonlinearity and stochastic disturbance. In order to cope with general nonlinear tasks, this project will include neural networks which have been proved to be more effective as approximators of general nonlinear functions than more traditional systems.  The chief novelty here is the ability to combine these capabilities with the presence of communication delays and random discrete events, which are an important practical issue in most NCS.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0						1406533								Missouri University of Science and Technology				2023-12-08	GRANTS:14029622		
J	Wang, Chun; Liu, Fengchen; Tang, Aihua; Liu, Rui				Tang, Aihua/AFR-6183-2022						A dynamic programming-optimized two-layer adaptive energy management strategy for electric vehicles considering driving pattern recognition								JOURNAL OF ENERGY STORAGE				70						107924			10.1016/j.est.2023.107924					JUN 2023		Article; Early Access		2023	To achieve optimal real-time power allocation in electric vehicles, a two-layer adaptive dynamic programming (DP) optimization energy management strategy (EMS) has been proposed. The upper layer uses learning vector quantization (LVQ) to produce real-time driving pattern recognition (DPR) results. The method determines 10 characteristic parameters for training the recognition network and the length of the sampling window is 120 s. The typical driving cycles are divided into different levels of blocks to identify the real-time DPR level. The lower layer adopts the optimization strategy of DP extraction to adjust the power distribution between the battery pack and the supercapacitor pack according to the recognition results. DP is used to define a cost function to minimize the energy loss of the hybrid energy storage system (HESS) and optimize the battery usage range in the system. The near-optimal real-time EMS is extracted by analyzing the DP control behavior of the battery under the layered state of charge (SOC). The simulation results indicate that the proposed new rule control based on DP optimization (NRB) EMS improves the system efficiency by 10 % compared with the original rule-based (RB) EMS under different temperatures and DPR levels. In addition, the system efficiency gap is controlled at 3 % compared with DP.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			2352-152X	2352-1538										Sichuan Univ Sci & Engn, Sch Mech Engn, 519 Huixing Rd, Zigong 643000, Sichuan, Peoples R ChinaChongqing Univ Technol, Sch Vehicle Engn, 69 Hongguang Rd, Chongqing 400054, Peoples R China				2023-08-02	WOS:001032360400001

A systematic literature review								AUTOMATED SOFTWARE ENGINEERING				29	2					38			10.1007/s10515-022-00337-x							Review	NOV 2022	2022	Context Machine Learning (ML) has been at the heart of many innovations over the past years. However, including it in so-called "safety-critical" systems such as automotive or aeronautic has proven to be very challenging, since the shift in paradigm that ML brings completely changes traditional certification approaches. Objective This paper aims to elucidate challenges related to the certification of ML-based safety-critical systems, as well as the solutions that are proposed in the literature to tackle them, answering the question "How to Certify Machine Learning Based Safety-critical Systems?". Method We conduct a Systematic Literature Review (SLR) of research papers published between 2015 and 2020, covering topics related to the certification of ML systems. In total, we identified 217 papers covering topics considered to be the main pillars of ML certification: Robustness, Uncertainty, Explainability, Verification, Safe Reinforcement Learning, and Direct Certification. We analyzed the main trends and problems of each sub-field and provided summaries of the papers extracted. Results The SLR results highlighted the enthusiasm of the community for this subject, as well as the lack of diversity in terms of datasets and type of ML models. It also emphasized the need to further develop connections between academia and industries to deepen the domain study. Finally, it also illustrated the necessity to build connections between the above mentioned main pillars that are for now mainly studied separately. Conclusion We highlighted current efforts deployed to enable the certification of ML based software systems, and discuss some future research directions.									9	0	0	0	0	0	10			0928-8910	1573-7535										Polytech Montreal, Montreal, PQ, CanadaLaval Univ, Quebec City, PQ, Canada				2022-04-22	WOS:000782599100001

WPT systems based on inductive and magnetic resonance technologies generate strong but rapidly decaying magnetic fields, which often exceed reference levels (RL) in the immediate vicinity of the WPT coils by up to a factor of >100. Compliance testing of WPT systems with limits derived for homogeneous exposure can lead to estimations of exposure that exceed by up to 40 dB assessments of the fields induced in the human body, i.e., the basic restrictions (BR) defined by the international safety guidelines. Testing compliance with the BR is impractical for regulatory purposes due to the high costs of resources of determining the maximum exposure conditions. This paper presents a novel compliance testing method that mitigates the overestimation of the exposure while maintaining the simplicity of the testing procedure. This is achieved by using coupling transformation functions to correlate not only the amplitude and frequency but also the gradient of the incident field with the BR. These novel conservative coupling functions have been determined by means of a large scale numerical study in the frequency range 3 kHz-10 MHz supported by a physics-based approximation. The here proposed compliance testing method is still conservative in comparison to the compliance toward BR of localized sources. However, in comparison to today's practice of applying RL directly, the overestimation is strongly reduced for high gradient fields (G(n) > 50 T/m/T), e.g., by more than 3000 times for field gradients of about 200 T/m/T. We have validated the method by numerical analysis of human exposure to actual WPT sources. The adoption of the new method will help to accelerate the introduction of high-power wireless charging devices in the global market.									7	0	0	0	2	0	7			0018-9375	1558-187X										Swiss Fed Inst Technol Zurich, Fdn Res Informat Technol Soc, CH-8092 Zurich, SwitzerlandGdansk Univ Technol, PL-80233 Gdansk, Poland				2020-09-01	WOS:000560360900036

Today's engine control development relies on traditional map-based and model-based control approaches. Due to growing system complexity and real-world requirements, these expert-intensive and time-consuming approaches are facing a turning point, which will lead to unacceptable development time and costs in the near future. Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a disruptive technology, which has interesting features that can tackle these challenges. AI-based methods have received growing interest due to the increasing availability of data and the success of AI applications for complex problems. This paper presents an overview of the state-of-the-art in Machine Learning (ML)-based methods that are applied for engine control development with focus on the time-consuming calibration process. The overview here shows that the vast majority of studies concentrates on regression modelling to model complex processes, to reduce the number of model parameters and to develop real-time, ECU implementable models. The identified promising directions for future ML-based engine control research include the application of reinforcement learning methods to on-line optimize engine performance and guarantee robust performance and unsupervised learning methods for data quality monitoring.

The output voltage can be increased by controlling the transistor switching frequency, duty cycle, inductance, load capacitor, rise, and fall time. Both computer simulation and experiment results are performed in details. Experiment results have shown an error less than 6 % with the simulation. A linear trend of output voltage in the range of 4 V to 49 V is successfully converted from 100 mV to 1.5 V input voltage using low switching frequency of 2 kHz. The circuit parameter for this voltage range are L = 100 muH, D = 50 %, tr = tf = 2.9 mus considering CL= 10 muF, and RL= 10 kOmega.

J	Kapoor, Rahul; Wilde, Daniel										Peering into a crystal ball: Forecasting behavior and industry foresight								STRATEGIC MANAGEMENT JOURNAL				44	3			704	736				10.1002/smj.3450					AUG 2022		Article; Early Access		2023	Research Summary What makes some managers and entrepreneurs better at forecasting the industry context than others? We argue that, regardless of experience or expertise, a learning-based forecasting behavior in which individuals attend to and incorporate new relevant information from the environment into an updated belief that aligns with the Bayesian belief updating process is likely to generate superior industry foresight. However, the effectiveness of such a cognitively demanding process diminishes under high levels of uncertainty. We find support for these arguments using an experimental design of forecasting tournaments in the managerially relevant context of the global automotive industry from 2016 to 2019. The study provides a novel account of individual-level forecasting behavior and its effectiveness in an evolving industry and suggests important implications for managers and entrepreneurs. Managerial Summary How a focal industry will evolve is a key forecasting problem faced by managers and entrepreneurs as they seek to identify opportunities and make strategic decisions. However, developing superior industry foresight in the face of significant change, and limited and often contradictory information, can be especially challenging. We study how individuals forecast the ongoing transformation of the global automotive industry with respect to electrification and autonomy, using a novel research design of forecasting tournaments. A forecasting process in which individuals update their beliefs by neither ignoring prior information nor overacting to new information helps to generate superior industry foresight. There was a significant penalty to forecasting accuracy when individuals did not update their beliefs at all, or when they updated, but overreacted to new information.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			0143-2095	1097-0266										Univ Penn, Wharton Sch, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA				2022-08-18	WOS:000837794000001

Machine learning is used for autonomous car driving and robot control, and the use of its applications is rapidly increasing in factory automation (FA). On the other hand, practical process control techniques based on machine learning and AI have not yet been developed for process automation (PA) although data analysis using process data is becoming more common. PID control still remains the main technique and advanced control techniques by experts are used when complicated control is required. Not to simulate but to apply machine learning technology to actual equipment, we performed AI-based control of a three-tank-level control system, which is a popular educational kit for process control. This paper introduces the details of the experiment and the machine learning technology used to control this system.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0911-8977											AI Bus. Dev. Dept., Inf. Technol.

This paper proposes a novel design framework that uses Federated learning-Artificial intelligence (FAI) for decision-making and Smart Contract (SC) policies for process execution and control in a completely automated smart automobile manufacturing industry. The proposed design introduces a novel element called Trust Threshold Limit (TTL) that helps moderate the excess usage of embedded equipment, tools, energy, and cost functions, limiting wastages in the manufacturing processes. This research highlights the use cases of AI in decentralised Blockchain with smart contracts, the company's trading policies, and its advantages for effectively handling market risk assessments during socio-economic crisis. The developed model supported by real-time cases incorporated cost functions, delivery time and energy evaluations. Results spotlight the use of FAI in decision accuracy for the developed smart contract-based Automobile Assembly Model (AAM), thereby qualitatively limiting the threshold level of cost, energy and other control functions in procurement assembly and manufacturing. Customisation and graphical user interface with cloud integration are some challenges of this model.									16	0	0	0	1	0	16			0020-7543	1366-588X										Nanyang Technol Univ, Singapore, SingaporeEM Normandie Business Sch, Metis Lab, Le Havre, FranceMacquarie Univ, Macquarie Business Sch, Dept Management, Sydney, NSW, AustraliaUniv Int Rabat, Rabat Business Sch, Rabat, MoroccoUniv Sheffield, Advanced Resource Efficiency Ctr, Sheffield, S Yorkshire, EnglandUniv Sheffield, Sch Management, Sheffield, S Yorkshire, England	EM Normandie Business Sch			2021-10-29	WOS:000708726200001

First, the resources of edge servers are shared by multiple vehicles, leading to random changes over time. Second, as a vehicle would drive across consecutive edge servers, the offloading strategy needs to consider the overall edge resources along the trip. Third, at each vehicle, the computing tasks arrive continuously when driving. This dictates the offloading strategy to consider not only the current status but also the futuristic computing tasks. To tackle these issues, we propose a digital twin (DT) network framework. A DT network maintains DTs in the cyber-space to synchronize the real-world activities of vehicles. Therefore, task offloading decisions can be benefited by combining both the global information aggregated from neighbor twins and historical information uploaded by vehicles. With comprehensive information, the optimal offloading strategy can be determined. We characterize the offloading problem as a Markov Decision Process (MDP) and develop an A3C-based decision-making algorithm, which can learn optimal offloading actions that minimize the long-term system costs. Extensive experiments demonstrate the performance of our proposal in terms of fast convergence and low system costs when compared with other approaches.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2327-4697											Xidian Univ, Sch Cyber Engn, Xian 710126, Peoples R ChinaNorthwestern Polytech Univ, Sch Comp Sci, Xian 710072, Peoples R ChinaUniv Michigan, Elect Engn & Comp Sci Dept, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USAMuroran Inst Technol, Dept Sci & Informat, Muroran 0500071, JapanUniv Macau, Fac Sci & Technol, Macau 999078, Peoples R China				2024-02-11	WOS:001139144400065

The optimization design of engine hood is a high-dimensional, multi-objective, and mixed-variable optimization problem. In order to reduce the physical test investment in the development and improve the efficiency of optimization, this article proposes a data-driven method for optimal hood design. A newly proposed single-objective optimization algorithm is improved by several strategies for multi-objective constrained problem with mixed variables. Then the hood is optimized through the specially designed machine learning model. Finally, both the hood's weight and pedestrian injury are reduced while maintaining structural stiffness and frequency in the desired range.

Autonomous Merging onto the Highway Using LSTM Neural Network								2023 11th RSI International Conference on Robotics and Mechatronics (ICRoM)								574	9				10.1109/ICRoM60803.2023.10412407							Conference Paper	2023	2023	Merging onto highways is a complex task for autonomous vehicles and can cause catastrophic crashes, especially when considering the high speeds of other vehicles in the highway. While methods like path tracking and reinforcement learning are commonly used to execute this task, they may not accurately imitate the behavior of an expert driver and simultaneously maintain accuracy, safety and passenger comfort. In this paper, we present an autonomous driver model that uses an LSTM neural network trained on data gathered from two expert drivers executing the maneuver in a driving simulator. We extracted five features from the dataset, and used them to train the neural network model. The model approximates the proper steering wheel angle at each time step and feeds it to a PD controller which sets the physical steering wheel angle by managing the input voltage of a DC motor mounted on the driving simulator's steering rod. The neural network model achieved an R2 score of 0.82057 and successfully guided the vehicle to merge onto the highway and reach the second lane without collisions in multiple trials in the simulator. The results of this research shows the potential of using expert driver data and neural networks to improve the accuracy and safety of merging onto highways in autonomous vehicles. As autonomous vehicles become more prevalent in the automotive industry, it is essential to develop reliable and safe highway-merging strategies. Our model provides a promising solution to this challenge and can be further developed and integrated into autonomous vehicles to enhance their capabilities and ensure safe and efficient merging onto highways.					2023 11th RSI International Conference on Robotics and Mechatronics (ICRoM)2023 11th RSI International Conference on Robotics and Mechatronics (ICRoM)	20232023		Tehran, IranTehran, Iran	0	0	0	0	0	0	0					979-8-3503-0810-5									Dept. of Mech.

This article proposes a novel deep-learning-based model for predicting energy consumption of an electric bus traveling in an urban area. The model addresses two important issues: accuracy and cost of prediction. The aim of the research was to develop the deep-learning-based prediction model, which requires only the data readily available to bus fleet operators, such as location of the bus stops (coordinates, altitude), route traveled, schedule, travel time between stops, and to find the most suitable type and configuration of neural network to evaluate the model. The developed prediction model was assessed with different types of deep neural networks using real data collected for several bus lines in a medium-sized city in Poland. Conducted research has shown that the deep learning network with autoencoders (DLNA) neural network allows for the most accurate energy consumption estimation of 93%. The proposed model can be used by public transport companies to plan driving schedules and energy management when introducing electric buses.									5	0	0	0	0	0	5				1996-1073										Silesian Tech Univ, Fac Transport & Aviat Engn, PL-40019 Katowice, PolandRockwell Automat, PL-40382 Katowice, Poland	Rockwell Automat			2022-03-29	WOS:000771172700001

Client-based Intelligence for Resource Efficient Vehicular Big Data Transfer in Future 6G Network [arXiv]								arXiv								15 pp.	15 pp.											Journal Paper	17 Feb. 2021	2021	Vehicular big data is anticipated to become the "new oil" of the automotive industry which fuels the development of novel crowdsensing-enabled services. However, the tremendous amount of transmitted vehicular sensor data represents a massive challenge for the cellular network. A promising method for achieving relief which allows to utilize the existing network resources in a more efficient way is the utilization of intelligence on the end-edge-cloud devices. Through machine learning-based identification and exploitation of highly resource efficient data transmission opportunities, the client devices are able to participate in overall network resource optimization process. In this work, we present a novel client-based opportunistic data transmission method for delay-tolerant applications which is based on a hybrid machine learning approach: Supervised learning is applied to forecast the currently achievable data rate which serves as the metric for the reinforcement learning-based data transfer scheduling process. In addition, unsupervised learning is applied to uncover geospatially-dependent uncertainties within the prediction model. In a comprehensive real world evaluation in the public cellular networks of three German Mobile Network Operators (MNOs), we show that the average data rate can be improved by up to 223 % while simultaneously reducing the amount of occupied network resources by up to 89 %. As a side-effect of preferring more robust network conditions for the data transfer, the transmission-related power consumption is reduced by up to 73 %. The price to pay is an increased Age of Information (AoI) of the sensor data.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0														Commun. Networks Inst., Tech. Univ.

The obvious feature of the TWBs is the existence of weld lines. This paper numerically compares the modelling strategies of the weld line under quasi-static and dynamic events. A novel method with crossover scheme is proposed. For the quasi-static tests, those existing modelling methods such as rigid links (RL), onefold beam (OB)/twofold beam (TB), shell (SH)/solid model (SN) and new crossover model are compared. Note that the SH/SN model is considered to be accurate and as the baseline model. Through the deformation analysis and equivalent plastic strains under the static scenario, it indicates that the novel scheme is superior to other modelling methods. Then, the method is further applied to dynamic impacting. Those results provide important information for numerical modelling especially when TWBs are fabricated through different materials with a relatively higher thickness ratio.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			0143-3369	1741-5314										Wuhan Univ Technol, Hubei Key Lab Adv Technol Automot Components, Wuhan 430070, Peoples R ChinaWuhan Univ Technol, Hubei Collaborat Innovat Ctr Automot Components T, Wuhan 430070, Peoples R China				2017-01-25	WOS:000391088300003

The proposed work provides a new mixed pooling strategy with enhanced performance for imbalanced vehicle dataset based on Convolution Neural Network (CNN). Pooling is crucial for improving spatial invariance, processing time, and overfitting in CNN architecture. Max and average pooling are often utilized in contemporary research articles. Both techniques of pooling have their own advantages and disadvantages. In this study, the advantages of both pooling algorithms are evaluated for the classification of three vehicles: car, bus, and truck for imbalanced datasets. For each epoch, the performance of max pooling, average pooling, and the new mixed pooling method was assessed using ROC, F1-score, and error rate. Comparing the performance of the max-pooling method to that of the average pooling method, it has been found that the max-pooling method is superior. The performance of the proposed mixed pooling approach is superior to that of the maximum pooling and average pooling methods. In terms of Receiver Operating Characteristics (ROC), the proposed mixed pooling technique is approximately 2 per cent better than the maximum pooling method and 8 per cent better than the mixed pooling method.

Having very small energy usually less than 1 V, needs a boost circuit to power up the device. This paper shows that the passive components of a conventional boost converter play an important role to boost very small voltage. This paper also presents that switching frequency effects to boost voltage. Transient analyses have been performed using PSpice simulation tool to check the circuit response to various parameter changes. The proposed circuit with components L=160 muH, RL=10 kOmega and switching frequency fS=1 kHz with duty cycle D=0.5 results optimum performance of the circuit. This voltage converter is suitable for vibration energy harvesting having low frequency applications in kHz range. The application of this converter is expected to be in automotive, healthcare and industrial field.					2013 IEEE International Conference on Smart Instrumentation, Measurement and Applications (ICSIMA)2013 IEEE International Conference on Smart Instrumentation, Measurement and Applications (ICSIMA)	25-27 Nov. 201325-27 Nov. 2013	IEEE Malaysia Sect.

Overheating results in severe motor deterioration and is thus of high concern for the machine's control strategy and its design. Lack of precise temperature estimations leads to lesser device utilization and higher material cost. In this work, several machine learning (ML) models are empirically evaluated on their estimation accuracy for the task of predicting latent high-dynamic magnet temperature profiles, specifically, ordinary least squares, support vector regression, k-nearest neighbors, randomized trees, and neural networks. Having test bench data available, it is shown that ML approaches relying merely on collected data meet the estimation performance of classical thermal models built on thermodynamic theory. Through benchmarking, this work reveals the potential of simpler ML models in terms of regression accuracy, model size, and their data demand in comparison to parameter-heavy deep neural networks, which were investigated in the literature before. Especially linear regression and simple feed-forward neural networks with optimized hyperparameters mark strong predictive quality at low to moderate model sizes.									24	0	0	0	0	0	25			0885-8969	1558-0059										Paderborn Univ, Dept Power Elect & Elect Drives, D-33098 Paderborn, GermanyPaderborn Univ, Automat Control Dept, D-33095 Paderborn, Germany				2021-08-15	WOS:000681269600048

Current protocols implement either heuristics to find solutions that are not guaranteed to be optimal or classic flooding. However, many future use cases, like automotive applications, industrial robotics, and multimedia broadcast, will require efficient yet reliable methods. In this work, we use contextual multi-armed bandits together with opportunistic routing (OR) and network coding (NC) to find approximately optimal solutions to the problem of broadcast routing in a distributed fashion. Each router independently learns its own transmission credit, i.e., the number of packets to forward for each innovative packet received, so that the airtime cost, subject to latency constraints, is minimized. Results show that the proposed solutions, particularly the deep learning based one, vastly improve the overall reliability, while performing close to MORE multicast in terms of airtime and to B.A.T.M.A.N. in latency, both being the best candidates in the respective discipline among the tested ones.					11th IEEE Annual Ubiquitous Computing, Electronics and Mobile Communication Conference (UEMCON)11th IEEE Annual Ubiquitous Computing, Electronics and Mobile Communication Conference (UEMCON)	OCT 28-31, 2020OCT 28-31, 2020	IEEE; IEEE New York Sect; IEEE Reg 1; Inst Engn & Management; SMART; IEEE USA; Univ Engn & ManagementIEEE; IEEE New York Sect; IEEE Reg 1; Inst Engn & Management; SMART; IEEE USA; Univ Engn & Management	ELECTR NETWORKELECTR NETWORK	0	0	0	0	0	0	0					978-1-7281-9656-5									Univ Padua, Dept Informat Engn, Via Gradenigo 6-B, I-35131 Padua, ItalyTech Univ Dresden, Chair Commun Networks, Helmholtzstr 18, D-01069 Dresden, Germany				2021-06-16	WOS:000652194300075

Finding faults: A scoping study of fault diagnostics for Industrial Cyber-Physical Systems [arXiv]								arXiv								19 pp.	19 pp.											Journal Paper	13 Jan. 2021	2021	Context: As Industrial Cyber-Physical Systems (ICPS) become more connected and widely-distributed, often operating in safety-critical environments, we require innovative approaches to detect and diagnose the faults that occur in them. Objective: We profile fault identification and diagnosis techniques employed in the aerospace, automotive, and industrial control domains. By examining both theoretical presentations as well as case studies from production environments, we present a profile of the current approaches being employed and identify gaps. Methodology: A scoping study was used to identify and compare fault detection and diagnosis methodologies that are presented in the current literature. Results: Fault identification and analysis studies from 127 papers published from 2004 to 2019 reveal a wide diversity of promising techniques, both emerging and in-use. These range from traditional Physics-based Models to Data-Driven Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Knowledge-Based approaches. Predictive diagnostics or prognostics featured prominently across all sectors, along with discussions of techniques including Fault trees, Petri nets and Markov approaches. We also profile some of the techniques that have reached the highest Technology Readiness Levels, showing how those methods are being applied in real-world environments beyond the laboratory. Conclusions: Our results suggest that the continuing wide use of both Model-Based and Data-Driven AI techniques across all domains, especially when they are used together in hybrid configuration, reflects the complexity of the current ICPS application space. While creating sufficiently-complete models is labor intensive, Model-free AI techniques were evidenced as a viable way of addressing aspects of this challenge, demonstrating the increasing sophistication of current machine learning systems.(Abridged).

Optimising these systems and their controllers might be possible with computationally efficient simulation. Unfortunately, state-of-the-art simulators are either too slow or provide little resolution of the cabin's thermal environment. In this work, we propose a novel approach to developing a fast simulation by machine learning (ML) from measurements within the car cabin over a number of trials within a climatic wind tunnel. A range of ML approaches are tried and compared. The best-performing ML approach is compared to more traditional 1D simulation in terms of accuracy and speed. The resulting simulation, based on Multivariate Linear Regression, is fast (5 microseconds per simulation second), and yields good accuracy (NRMSE 1.8%), which exceeds the performance of the traditional 1D simulator. Furthermore, the simulation is able to differentially simulate the thermal environment of the footwell versus the head and the driver position versus the front passenger seat, but unlike a traditional 1D model cannot support changes to the physical structure. This fast method for obtaining computationally efficient simulators of car cabins will accelerate adoption of techniques such as Deep Reinforcement Learning for climate control.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0				2297-3079										Coventry Univ, Ctr Computat Sci & Math Modeling, Coventry, EnglandCtr Ric Fiat SCpA, Orbassano, Italy				2022-04-24	WOS:000779591200001

Secure Data Communication in Vehicular Networks for Disaster Rescue								2022 International Conference on Futuristic Technologies (INCOFT)								1	6				10.1109/INCOFT55651.2022.10094552							Conference Paper	2022	2022	Ground recovery automobiles operating in the regions impacted by the catastrophe should coordinate their efforts and communicate a large amount of data with one another. This data should include rescue orders, details on the state of the roadways, and data on prior rescue missions. This will guarantee that you are able to drive safely and effectively respond. Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), which can be used to conduct instant recovery services in places that are destructed and assist in sharing data for ground Vehicular networks, can be utilised when connectivity investments are damaged as a consequence of climate change. UAVs can help share data for field Iot environments and can conduct recovery services in areas that have been damaged. However, in a tragedy scenario involving UAV-assisted IoV, there are possible safety threats on intelligence sharing among machines and UAVs. These threats are the outcome of an unreliable distributed environment, unreliable improper behavior tracing, and minimal information. These issues could compromise the integrity of shared data. The interconnection of the relevant vehicles and unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) makes these dangers possible. In this article, we create a lightweight vehicular blockchain-enabled secure (LVBS) data exchange architecture for the Automotive Internet of Things that is helped by unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) to assist in hurricane relief. The concerns which have been voiced will be addressed more effectively as a result of this. To begin, we will discuss the new UAV and smart contracts collaboration high - altitude system architectures that we have developed for usage in places that have been affected by natural disasters. A resource consensus method is developed for the lighter vehicular ecosystem in the second step of our project. This not only makes it possible for us to track and record data exchanges in a manner that is both safe and immutable, but it also helps us arrive at a majority more quickly while ensuring that its degree of safety is not compromised. In the end, comprehensive models are tested, which demonstrate that LVBS has the ability to effectively increase the safety of the consensual phase and stimulate the data exchange of a great quality. This is shown by the fact that LVBS has been shown to have this capacity.					2022 International Conference on Futuristic Technologies (INCOFT)2022 International Conference on Futuristic Technologies (INCOFT)	25-27 Nov. 202225-27 Nov. 2022		Belgaum, IndiaBelgaum, India	0	0	0	0	0	0	0					978-1-6654-5046-1									Dept. of Comput.

J									Gao, Weinan		ERI: Improving the Learning Efficiency of Adaptive Optimal Control Systems in Information-Limited Environments																												Awarded Grant	Jan 01 2022	2022	This Engineering Research Initiation (ERI) grant will fund research that enables efficient, on-the-fly learning of optimal control strategies for complex engineering systems operating in uncertain environments, with application to connected and autonomous vehicles, thereby promoting the progress of science and advancing the national prosperity and welfare. Many emerging control systems in the artificial intelligence, automotive, robotic, and energy fields require that optimal actions be identified and executed across a network of components in the absence of detailed system knowledge and based on limited input data. Learning-based approaches have been developed to meet this requirement, but are challenged by very slow rates of learning, restrictive requirements on the control policy used to initiate the learning process, and complications due to sensor limitations and sparse data sharing between individual components. This project will overcome these challenges by building a new learning-efficient control framework that integrates advantages of existing methods and demonstrates new solutions for handling missing data streams and optimizing the communication structure between system components. When applied to networks of autonomous vehicles in complex traffic scenarios, the framework may enable improvements in roadway safety and reduction in road fatalities. The broader impacts of this project include outreach efforts to the public intended to show how artificial intelligence and automatic control can be safely leveraged, as well as training and preparation of undergraduate and graduate students to pursue further education and advanced STEM careers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research aims to make fundamental contributions to the development of a learning-efficient, adaptive optimal control framework for nonlinear dynamical systems with completely unknown system models and under conditions of partial observability, and to enable the application of this framework to networked control systems with nontrivial communication topologies. It will achieve this outcome by developing a new hybrid iterative form of reinforcement learning that achieves a quadratic rate of convergence even if a system model and an initial admissible control policy are unavailable. Inspired by ideas from hierarchical reinforcement learning, a two-layer learning-efficient method will be created to enable simultaneous learning of robust distributed control strategies for individual network agents and an optimal network communication topology, including in the presence of communication delays between agents. Micro-traffic simulations and physical experiments will be used to test the theoretical framework in the context of collision avoidance in several formation control scenarios.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0						2138206								Florida Institute of Technology				2023-12-08	GRANTS:15516487

Sequential algorithms are adopted by most OEMs because of their interpretability and robustness. Planning module is the core of the sequential algorithm. It receives information from a perception module and high-definition map and outputs the driving trajectories or actions. Artificial potential field (APF) method, which is widely used in planning algorithms for autonomous driving, is becoming increasingly popular owing to its excellent planning efficiency and information extraction capability. However, APF does not consider destination factor, and single-point destination gravitational field causes a large force, resulting in incorrect directions for long-distance cases, and cannot cope with complex traffic environments. In response to these problems, this study proposed "Driving Intention & Risk Field" (IRF) to model traffic factors including destination, vehicles, and road boundaries and consider their characteristics separately and then in combination. A global gravitational field considering the global route was created, and a global planned path was discretized into equidistant path points. The path points within the range of the interest area were dynamically selected to construct a global gravitational field. To verify the performance of the IRF, an IRF-SAC decision-planning algorithm platform was built, and highway, urban crossroad, and roundabout scenes were set in a CARLA simulation environment. The research results show that compared with NF-SAC and FSM, the IRF-SAC algorithm significantly improves safety, comfort, and vehicle-passing efficiency. In the highway scenario, IRF-SAC achieves high accuracy and robustness in path tracking, and the maximum displacement errors are reduced by 44.8% and 70.2% compared with the FSM and NF-SAC algorithms, respectively. In the crossroad scenario, the average risk coefficients are reduced by 12.0% and 20.6%, and root mean squares of the longitudinal acceleration are reduced by 13.2% and 44.9%, compared with the NF-SAC and FSM algorithms, respectively. Moreover, the driving time is reduced by 39.2% compared with the FSM algorithm. In the roundabout scenario, the average risk coefficient is reduced by 31.7% and 52.9%, and the root mean square of the longitudinal acceleration is reduced by 27.0% and 19.0%, compared with the NF-SAC and FSM algorithms, respectively.			无人驾驶决策算法可以分为端到端的决策算法与分层式决策算法,分层式算法由于可解释性强、鲁棒性高而被大多数主机厂采用。规划模块是分层式决策算法中的核心模块,它承接感知与地图模块的信息并输出驾驶轨迹或动作,而人工势场法由于规划效率高、信息提取能力强,被越来越多地应用于无人驾驶决策规划领域。但现阶段的人工势场存在未考虑目的地因素或建立目的地单点引力场导致远距离引力过大、方向错误的问题,无法应对复杂交通环境。针对这些问题,提出一种无人驾驶"行车意图-风险复合场"(Driving Intention & Risk Field, IRF),根据目的地、车辆、道路边界等要素各自的特点分别建模,并以势场的形式统一在IRF中。创建考虑全局规划的全局引力场,将全局规划路径离散成等距离的路径点,并动态选取感兴趣范围内的路径点进行全局引力场的构建。为了验证模型的性能,搭建IRF-SAC动态规划算法平台,并在CARLA仿真环境分别设置高速公路场景、十字路口场景和环岛场景。研究结果表明:相比于NF-SAC和FSM,IRF-SAC算法在安全性、舒适性、通行效率上均有显著提升;在高速公路场景下,IRF-SAC显示出较强的路径跟踪精度和鲁棒性,最大位移偏差相对于NF-SAC和FSM算法分别下降了44.8%、70.2%;在十字路口场景下,与NF-SAC及FSM算法相比,平均危险系数分别降低12.0%、20.6%,纵向加速度均方根分别降低13.2%、44.9%,行驶时长相较于FSM算法减少了39.2%;在环岛场景下,与NF-SAC及FSM算法相比,平均危险系数分别降低了31.7%、52.9%,纵向加速度均方根分别降低了27.0%、19.0%。						0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1001-7372											华南理工大学机械与汽车工程学院, 广州, 广东 510640, 中国华南理工大学机械与汽车工程学院;;广州汽车集团股份有限公司汽车工程研究院, ;;, 广州;;广州, 广东;;广东 510640;;510640, 中国School of Mechanical & Automotive Engineering, South China University of Technology, Guangzhou, Guangdong 510640, ChinaSchool of Mechanical & Automotive Engineering, South China University of Technology;;GAC Automotive Engineering Institute, ;;, Guangzhou;;Guangzhou, Guangdong;;Guangdong 510640;;510640	华南理工大学机械与汽车工程学院华南理工大学机械与汽车工程学院;;广州汽车集团股份有限公司汽车工程研究院School of Mechanical & Automotive Engineering, South China University of TechnologySchool of Mechanical & Automotive Engineering, South China University of Technology;;GAC Automotive Engineering Institute			2023-04-14	CSCD:7364170

Presently, HM approaches such as the built-in self-test are based on reactive failure diagnostics and unable to determine residual-life (RL) or estimate residual-reliability. Prognostics health-monitoring (PHM) approach presented in this paper is different from state-of-art diagnostics and resides in the prefailure-space of the electronic system, in which no macro-indicators such as cracks or delamination exist. Applications for the presented PHM framework include, consumer and defense applications such as automotive safety systems including front and rear impact protection systems, chassis-control systems, x-by-wire systems, and defense applications such as avionics systems, naval electronic warfare systems. The presented PHM methodologies enable the estimation of prior damage in deployed electronics by the interrogation of the system state for systems in which the prior stress-history may be unknown or unavailable. The primary focus is on thermo-mechanical stresses. The presented methodologies will trigger repair or replacement, significantly prior to failure. The approach involves the use of condition monitoring devices which can be interrogated for damage proxies at finite time-intervals. The system's residual life is computed based on residual-life computation algorithms. Previously, we have developed several leading indicators of failure. In this paper, a mathematical approach has been presented to calculate the prior damage in electronics subjected to cyclic and isothermal thermo-mechanical loads. Electronic components operating in a harsh environment may be subjected to both temperature variations in addition to thermal aging during use-life. Data have been collected for leading indicators of failure for 95.5Sn4Ag0.5Cu first-level interconnects under both single and sequential applications of cyclic and isothermal thermo-mechanical loads. Methodology for the determination of prior damage history has been presented using non-linear least-squares method based on interrogation techniques. The methodology presented used the Levenberg-Marquardt Algorithm. The test vehicle includes various area-array packaging architectures soldered on immersion Ag finish, subjected to thermal cycling in the range of -40 degrees C to 125 degrees C and isothermal aging at 125 degrees C.									7	0	0	0	0	0	10			2156-3950	2156-3985										Auburn Univ, Dept Mech Engn, Natl Sci Fdn, Ctr Adv Vehicle & Extreme Environm Elect, Auburn, AL 36849 USAUniv Cincinnati, Dept Intelligent Maintenance Syst, Cincinnati, OH 45208 USA				2011-11-01	WOS:000297347200011		
J									Dixon,  Warren		Adaptive dynamic programming for uncertain nonlinear systems through coupling of nonlinear analysis and data-based learning																												Awarded Grant	Aug 01 2015	2015	Optimal control methods provide a means to associate a user-defined cost with control actions or decisions. These methods have made pervasive impacts in a wide class of application domains. The shift towards autonomy by the automotive industry in examples such as replacing mechanical systems with computer controlled electronic control systems, has resulted in efficiencies in fuel injection, braking, throttling, etc. For electric vehicles, fuel economy, drivability, and emission control are functions of the engine design and the control strategies. For robotic systems, the desire to achieve optimal behavior is essential for efficient task execution. Likewise, aerospace systems have always been a mainstream application domain for optimal control methods because there has always been (and always will be) a tight coupling between performance and energy/fuel costs. As the cost of energy and the awareness of the environmental impacts of producing energy have risen, optimal control may now play a timely role in a broader spectrum of application domains. The Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy office of the U.S. Department of Energy indicates that as much as 10-20 percent of American energy use could be saved by optimizing industrial systems. It is self-evident that optimal control solutions can have significant impacts in a wide range of industries, but the development of optimal control solutions for real engineering systems is limited by numerous technical barriers. The most fundamental and open-ended problems arise from barriers associated with developing optimal solutions in the presence of uncertainty. The driving question in this project is how to arbitrate between gaining knowledge about a system while simultaneously making the optimal control decision for engineering systems that are uncertain and complex.<br/><br/>The technical aims of this project are motivated by the hypothesis and observations from preliminary efforts that nonlinear analysis methods can be exploited to design real-time approximate optimal solutions, while concurrent background processing methods can be used to update the optimal control approximation for improved performance. Intellectual merits in this project are realized through the development of classes of closed-loop controllers with associated stability analysis, and advanced function approximation methods, that ensure sufficient exploration of the system response while learning the approximate optimal control solution. Outcomes of this research would allow for optimal control implementation in a broader class of application domains where the system exhibits nonlinear behaviors and uncertainty. The broad impact of this framework is a merger of methods that bridge the gap between the computational intelligence community and control systems community to enable data-based learning methods to optimize control performance.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0						1509516								University of Florida				2023-12-08	GRANTS:13548823

Novel inverter topologies for two-wheel drive electric vehicles with two permanent magnet synchronous motors								2007 European Conference on Power Electronics and Applications								1	10				10.1109/EPE.2007.4417667							Conference Paper	2007	2007	Novel topology of an inverter that can independently control two permanent magnet synchronous motors (PMSMs) is proposed. In conventional, 12 switching devices, i.e. two three-phase three-leg inverters, are required to control two PMSMs; thus, the equipment size becomes large. The proposed inverter requires the same number of switches as the conventional inverter, i.e. only 6 switching devices. In this paper, the circuit configuration and control principle of the proposed inverter are introduced; and a controller was constructed using an FPGA. Moreover, the basic characteristics of the inverter, which is connected with two Y-connected RL loads, are shown through computer simulations and experiments. As a result, it was verified through the simulations and the experiments that the proposed inverter could output different amplitude and frequency for each load.					2007 European Conference on Power Electronics and Applications2007 European Conference on Power Electronics and Applications	2-5 Sept. 20072-5 Sept. 2007		Aalborg, DenmarkAalborg, Denmark	7	0	0	0	0	0	7					978-90-75815-10-8									Ibaraki Univ., Hitachi, Japan				2007-01-01	INSPEC:9852702

It is used for solving reliability problems that often manifest due to complexities in design, manufacturing, operating environment and system maintenance. For safety-critical applications, using a model-based development process for complex systems might not always be ideal but it is equally important to establish the robustness of the solution. The information revolution has allowed data-driven methods to diffuse within this field to construct the requisite process (or system models) to cope with the so-called big data phenomenon. This is supported by large datasets that help machine-learning models achieve impressive accuracy. AI technologies are now being integrated into many PHM related applications including aerospace, automotive, medical robots and even autonomous weapon systems. However, with such rapid growth in complexity and connectivity, a systems' behaviour is influenced in unforeseen ways by cyberattacks, human errors, working with incorrect or incomplete models and even adversarial phenomena. Many of these models depend on the training data and how well the data represents the test data. These issues require fine-tuning and even retraining the models when there is even a small change in operating conditions or equipment. Yet, there is still ambiguity associated with their implementation, even if the learning algorithms classify accordingly. Uncertainties can lie in any part of the AI-based PHM model, including in the requirements, assumptions, or even in the data used for training and validation. These factors lead to sub-optimal solutions with an open interpretation as to why the requirements have not been met. This warrants the need for achieving a level of robustness in the implemented PHM, which is a challenging task in a machine learning solution. This article aims to present a framework for testing the robustness of AI-based PHM. It reviews some key milestones achieved in the AI research community to deal with three particular issues relevant for AI-based PHM in safety-critical applications: robustness to model errors, robustness to unknown phenomena and empirical evaluation of robustness during deployment. To deal with model errors, many techniques from probabilistic inference and robust optimisation are often used to provide some robustness guarantee metric. In the case of unknown phenomena, techniques include anomaly detection methods, using causal models, the construction of ensembles and reinforcement learning. It elicits from the authors' work on fault diagnostics and robust optimisation via machine learning techniques to offer guidelines to the PHM research community. Finally, challenges and future directions are also examined; on how to better cope with any uncertainties as they appear during the operating life of an asset.									10	0	0	0	0	0	10			1367-5788	1872-9088										Univ Tokyo, Dept Aeronaut & Astronaut, Tokyo 1138654, JapanJapan Aerosp Explorat Agcy, Res & Dev Directorate, Sagamihara, Kanagawa 2525210, Japan				2021-07-15	WOS:000664938900009		
J									Khargonekar,  Pramod	Baldi,  Pierre	EAGER: Real-Time: Reinforcement, Meta, and Episodic Learning for Control under Uncertainty																												Awarded Grant	Oct 01 2018	2018	Machine learning and artificial intelligence are among the most important general purpose technologies for the coming decades, with potential to transform all aspects of society from health, to manufacturing, to business, to education, and to security. In the last decade, there have been very important and impressive advances in machine learning driven by the use of deep neural networks, innovative training algorithms, computational resources including specialized hardware (graphics processors, tensor processing units), and large datasets. Some of these developments have connections to emerging understanding from neuroscience on how the human brain learns to makes decisions in real-time. However, there are major challenges in the use of these techniques in real-time control and decision making for engineering systems where stability, reliability, and safety are paramount concerns. This project aims to connect major advances in machine learning and neuroscience to control systems and thereby advance myriad application domains. Modern engineered systems are increasingly complicated. They comprise large heterogeneous distributed networks of (IoT) connected devices, systems, and human/social agents, e.g., transportation, energy, water, manufacturing, health and agriculture. A major challenge is performance, stability and reliability of these systems under large uncertainties. The goal is to expand our understanding and integration of learning and control to derive principles and algorithms for the development of learning-based control systems for a variety of engineering applications.  <br/><br/>While there are significant historical connections between reinforcement learning and stochastic dynamic control, the potential for leveraging ongoing and future advances in machine learning for control remains significantly under- explored. The field of control systems has deep and solid theoretical and mathematical foundations with comprehensive and well-established frameworks for linear, nonlinear, robust, adaptive, stochastic, distributed, and model-predictive control systems. Equally importantly, control systems have applications in multiple domains, such as aerospace, automotive, manufacturing, energy, transportation, agriculture, water, and many other engineered and socio-technical systems. Despite this rich spectrum of theoretical foundations and important applications, the domain of applicability of traditional control techniques is limited to situations where good mathematical models of the underlying systems are available, and where the environmental uncertainty is not too large. This exploratory research project is aimed at overcoming these limitations via novel problem formulations in systems and control inspired by new insights coming from recent developments in machine learning.  A key focus will be on novel control architectures inspired by neuroscience and reinforcement learning. Besides architectural innovations, the project will explore questions of stability, performance, and uncertainty by integrating ideas from rapid (one-shot) learning, meta-learning, and episodic control into control algorithms. The ideas from this project will be at the core of a new graduate level course in learning for control which will be taught at the University of California, Irvine. The resulting course materials will be made available to the research community and will benefit interested graduate students across the nation. In addition, short courses will be offered at major professional conferences, e. g., American Control Conference, IEEE Conference on Decision and Control.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0						1839429								University of California-Irvine				2023-12-08	GRANTS:13825829

The semi-active HBS is composed by Nickel Cobalt Rechargeable (NCR) and lithium titanate (LTO) batteries with a bi-directional DC/DC converter. First, the vehicle dynamics and the HBS are modelled. Second, a hierarchical optimal sizing method is proposed to minimize the distance-based cost (DBC) of electric taxi in a variety of driving cycles. The lower layer optimizes the energy management strategy (EMS) with dynamic programming (DP), while the upper layer optimizes the sizes of HBS for minimum DBC. Based on the sizing results, the DBC decreases firstly and then increases with the increasing LTO size. In addition, the results of DP indicate the SOC of the LTO batteries works between 50% and 80% for optimal NCR lifespan. Third, by using the rule extracted from DP, a learning-based EMS, i.e., deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG), is proposed with excellent real-time control potential. Finally, the simulation results show that the proposed DDPG EMS achieves the improved performance than fuzzy logic control EMS and closed result with what can be achieved through DP, yet the computation time is much less.

J	Cheng, Xingxing; Zhang, Rongquan; Bu, Siqi										A data-driven approach for collaborative optimization of large-scale electric vehicles considering energy consumption uncertainty								ELECTRIC POWER SYSTEMS RESEARCH				221						109461			10.1016/j.epsr.2023.109461					MAY 2023		Article; Early Access		2023	With the explosive growth of electric vehicles (EVs), it is an urgent task to incorporate low-carbon EVs with advanced optimization strategies to achieve orderly charging-discharging and economical operations for EVs. Nevertheless, current charging-discharging optimization strategies for EVs may be impractical since their energy consumption uncertainty and the driving trip cost are generally not considered. Therefore, a collaborative optimization model for large-scale EV charging-discharging with energy consumption uncertainty in this paper is proposed to simultaneously maximize passenger revenue and reduce the costs of the driving, charging-discharging, and battery depletion. Subsequently, a data-driven approach is developed to tackle the model. In this approach, an uncertainty predictor based on wavelet transform, deep deterministic policy gradient, and quantile regression is first applied to estimate the energy consumption uncertainty. Then, an adaptive learning rate firefly algorithm is presented to identify the most satisfactory solution for the optimization model. Finally, taking the actual data of 300 EVs in a city in China as case studies, the simulation results reveal that the proposed method is effective and has high application significance.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			0378-7796	1873-2046										Nanchang JiaoTong Inst, Coll Transportat, Nanchang 330044, Peoples R ChinaHong Kong Polytech Univ, Dept Elect Engn, Hong Kong, Peoples R China	Nanchang JiaoTong Inst			2023-06-15	WOS:001002140700001

The environment that needs to be dealt with,including many factors such as roads,surrounding traffic and weather conditions,is becoming increasing complex. Limited by the development cycle and cost,especially safety factors and the consideration of complex and diverse working conditions,traditional open road or closed field tests are difficult to meet the requirements of intelligent driving testing. Therefore,simulation test based on digital virtual technology has become a new important means for intelligent driving testing and verification. The simulation test mainly adopts a combination of accurate physical modeling,efficient numerical simulation,and high-fidelity image rendering to realistically construct human-vehicle environment models,including vehicles,roads,weather and lighting,and traffic, and various types of vehicles. The construction of virtual scenarios is a key technology simulation and is particularly important for improving the pressure and acceleration of intelligent driving testing. The virtual scenarios can meet the needs of a large number of diverse test samples to reflect the complex and changeable application environment of intelligent driving. They can also provide a large number of labeled datasets for machine learning that can contain rich data with boundary feature scenario content and lay a solid data foundation for deep learning perception and reinforcement learning planning algorithms. Therefore,the simulation scenario construction technology for intelligent driving test has been investigated worldwide in the current automotive intelligence. As an emerging technology,it still faces many challenges,and its methods need to be studied in depth. This paper systematically expounds the progress and current situation of domestic and foreign studies in simulation scenario construction technology,including automatic scenario construction methods and traffic simulation modeling methods,and focuses on some issues worthy of in-depth study. In the research of scenario construction methods, the key elements and characteristics of the limited scenarios can reflect the infinite richness and complex driving environment. A deep understanding of the network structure and mutual coupling of the scenario is essential for the research of virtual scenario construction. Establishing a description method of the scenario limit and boundary characteristics to form the scenario automated generation method can maximize the potential of accelerated testing of intelligent driving. Researchers have promoted the rapid development of scenario generation technology from different perspectives. However,they often use parameter traversal search ideas to determine the system state space. The development and testing is time consuming and labor intensive due to the unlimited expansion of scenario search. The construction of a scenario with dangerous characteristics requires in-depth exploration of the safety boundary of the ego vehicle driving. Thus,the constructed corner scenario can provide effective information corresponding to real driving for realizing the enhanced generation of the corner characteristics of the scenario. This condition responds to the accelerated testing of intelligent driving systems above level four. In terms of traffic modeling methods,a deep understanding of the driving behavior and interaction characteristics of vehicles is the basis and primary task. Determining the influence law of vehicle driving motion in data information and establishing the traffic model with random dangerous characteristics are the key to realize intelligent driving testing.			随着汽车智能化程度的不断提高,智能汽车通过环境传感器与周边行驶环境的信息交互与互联更为密切,需应对的行驶环境状况也越来越复杂,包括行驶道路、周边交通和气象条件等诸多因素,具有较强的不确定性、难以重复、不可预测和不可穷尽。限于研发周期和成本、工况复杂多样性,特别是安全因素的考虑,传统的开放道路测试试验或基于封闭试验场的测试难以满足智能驾驶系统可靠性与鲁棒性的测试要求。因此,借助数字虚拟技术的仿真测试成为智能驾驶测试验证一种新的手段,仿真场景的构建作为模拟仿真的重要组成部分,是实现智能驾驶测试中大样本、极限边界小概率样本测试验证的关键技术,这对提升智能驾驶系统的压力和加速测评水平显得尤为重要。面向智能驾驶测试的仿真场景构建技术已成为当前汽车智能化新的研究课题和世界性的研究热点,作为一种新兴技术仍面临许多挑战。本文提出了面向智能驾驶测试的仿真场景构建方法,系统阐述了国内外研究工作的进展与现状,包括场景自动构建方法和交通仿真建模方法,重点分析一些值得深入研究的问题并围绕场景构建技术的发展趋势进行了讨论分析,最后介绍了团队相关研究在2020中国智能驾驶挑战赛仿真赛和世界智能驾驶挑战赛的仿真场景应用情况。						1	7	0	0	0	0	8			1006-8961											北京航空航天大学交通科学与工程学院, 北京 100191, 中国北京航空航天大学交通科学与工程学院;;北京航空航天大学;;吉林大学, ;;大数据科学与脑机智能高精尖创新中心;;汽车仿真与控制国家重点实验室, ;;;;长春, 北京;;北京;; 100191;;100191;;130025, 中国吉林大学, 汽车仿真与控制国家重点实验室, 长春, 吉林 130025, 中国浙江天行健智能科技有限公司, 嘉兴, 浙江 314000, 中国School of Transportation Science & Engineering,Beihang University, Beijing 100191, ChinaSchool of Transportation Science & Engineering,Beihang University;;Beihang University;;Jilin University, ;;Beijing Advanced Innovation Center for Big Data and Brain Computing;;State Key Laboratory of Automotive Simulation and Control, ;;;;Changchun, Beijing;;Beijing;; 100191;;100191;;130025Jilin University, State Key Laboratory of Automotive Simulation and Control, Changchun, Jilin 130025, ChinaPanoSim Technology Company, Limited, Jiaxing, Zhejiang 314000, China	北京航空航天大学交通科学与工程学院北京航空航天大学交通科学与工程学院;;北京航空航天大学;;吉林大学吉林大学浙江天行健智能科技有限公司School of Transportation Science & Engineering,Beihang UniversitySchool of Transportation Science & Engineering,Beihang University;;Beihang University;;Jilin UniversityJilin UniversityPanoSim Technology Company, Limited			2021-05-21	CSCD:6912184

However, the cooperation of the COWHP, the hydrogen pipeline transportation, the power network transmission, and the hydrogen fuel cell electric vehicles (HFCEVs) scheduling is still an essential problem. This problem falls into the category of mixed-integer nonlinear optimization, which involves a significant number of decision variables and constraints. Existing methods have often struggled to effectively solve this problem due to its inherent complexity and non-linear nature. In this paper, a price-guided method is proposed to cooperate with this complex system. First, the COWHP model, the hydrogen pipeline network scheduling model, the power network flow model, the HFCEVs refuelling microgrid model, and the HFCEV traffic flow model in real-world transportation networks are presented. Second, the price-based cooperation model is proposed. Third, price strategies are deployed to cooperate with the complex system. The decision making trial and evaluation laboratory-the technique for order preference by similarity to ideal solution (Dematel-TOPSIS) method is deployed to evaluate the real-time performance of different strategies. The simulation results reveal that in the small vehicle flow transportation network cases, deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG) has the best real-time evaluation performance; whereas for the large vehicle flow transportation network cases, long short term memory (LSTM) has the best real-time performance. From the posterior evaluation view, LSTM has the best performance for all cases to reduce total operation cost, and also reduce the total waiting time.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2169-3536											Shenzhen Univ, Coll Chem & Environm Engn, Shenzhen 518060, Peoples R ChinaNanjing Univ Aeronaut & Astronaut, Coll Civil Aviat, Nanjing 211106, Peoples R ChinaUniv Alberta, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Edmonton, AB T6G 1H9, CanadaSouthern Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Mech & Energy Engn, Shenzhen 518055, Peoples R China				2023-11-28	WOS:001103039100001

J									Kim, Duck Bong		Investigations into the Design Rules for the Control of Wire Arc Additive Manufacturing																												Awarded Grant	Jul 01 2020	2020	This award advances the understanding of defect formation in wire arc additive manufacturing, leading to improved processing and greater process control. This research addresses surface waviness and nonuniform wall thickness challenges in wire arc additive manufacturing, making it acceptable for many U.S. industries, including aerospace, defense, and automotive, and thereby benefiting the nations economy and well-being.  Wire arc additive manufacturing uses a welding arc as the energy source in making three-dimensional objects with high throughput. This process can be easily integrated with existing computer-numerical-control routers, or robot arms. Thus, the knowledge and methodology developed through this project can be directly transferred to small- and medium-sized enterprises interested in making or repairing metallic parts. Additionally, this project develops the professional skills of K-12, undergraduate, and graduate students, including women and underrepresented minorities, by training them through a unique set of integrated education and multidisciplinary research opportunities in the areas of wire arc additive manufacturing and data analytics. Accordingly, students are familiarized with emerging technology-intensive manufacturing and data science disciplines, thereby preparing a future workforce equipped with these new skills and knowledge. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The two overarching research goals of this project are to (1) gain fundamental knowledge about surface waviness and effective wall thickness formation mechanisms in wire arc additive manufacturing and (2) investigate the design rules for the monitoring and control of the manufacturing process. An integrated experimental-characterization and theoretical-modeling framework are considered to achieve these goals. The surface quality of wire arc additively manufactured structures is controlled by fine-tuning and balancing the surface tension, arc force, droplet impact, gravity, buoyancy, and friction for different manufacturing conditions. The project framework consists of four components: (1) measurement and analysis of real-time process signatures (e.g., voltage and current) and visualization data of the arc, droplet, and weld pool features; (2) data measurements and analysis of defect (e.g., balling effect and voids) generation and propagation as a function of process parameters, wall thickness and inclination, and multi-bead/multilayer deposition; (3) characterization of the surface tension-based computational fluid dynamics model and its verification and validation through experiments; and (4) establishment of design rules using data-driven, low-fidelity surrogate models. Machine learning algorithms (e.g., convolutional neural network, AnoGAN, transfer learning, and reinforcement learning) are developed in detail for defect detections and classifications as well as process control. This integrated framework provides unique, transformative, and efficient opportunities to synergistically understand the arc, droplet, and weld pool characteristics and defect formation in wire arc additive manufacturing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0						2015693								Tennessee Technological University				2023-12-08	GRANTS:15133451

They are promising for stand-alone and embedded applications in the automotive industry, microcontrollers, Internet of Things, frame buffer memory, and slow SRAM. The MRAM cell usually includes a CoFeB fixed reference layer and a free magnetic layer (FL), separated by a tunnel barrier. To design ultra-scaled MRAM cells it is necessary to accurately model the torques acting on the magnetization in composite magnetic layers with one or several nonmagnetic inclusions between the ferromagnetic parts. The magnetization dynamics is governed by the Landau-Lifshitz- Gilbert (LLG) equation supplemented with the corresponding torques. The torques depend on nonequilibrium spin accumulation generated by an electric current. The electric current and the spin accumulation also depend on the magnetization. Therefore, the LLG and the spin-charge transport equations are coupled and must be solved simultaneously. We apply the finite element method (FEM) to numerically solve this coupled system of partial differential equations. To develop an open source solver, we use well-developed C++ FEM libraries. The computationally most expensive part is the demagnetizing field calculation. It is performed by a hybrid finite element-boundary element method. This confines the simulation domain for the field evaluation to the ferromagnets only. Advanced compression algorithms for large, dense matrices are used to optimize the performance of the demagnetizing field calculation in complex structures. To evaluate the torques acting on the magnetization, a coupled spin and charge transport approach is implemented. For the computation of the torques acting in a magnetic tunnel junction (MTJ), a magnetization-dependent resistivity of the tunnel barrier is introduced. A fully three-dimensional solution of the equations is performed to accurately model the torques acting on the magnetization. The use of a unique set of equations for the whole memory cell including the FL, fixed layer, contacts, and nonmagnetic spacers is one of the advantages of our approach. To incorporate the temperature increase due to the electric current, we solve the heat transport equation coupled to the electron, spin, and magnetization dynamics, and we demonstrate that the FL temperature is highly inhomogeneous due to a non-uniform magnetization of the FL during switching. Spin-orbit torque (SOT) MRAM is fast-switching and thus well suitable for caches. By means of micromagnetic simulations, we demonstrate the purely electrical switching of a perpendicular FL by the SOTs due to two orthogonal short current pulses. To further optimize the pulse sequence, a machine learning approach based on reinforcement learning is employed. Importantly, a neural network trained on a fixed material parameter set achieves switching for a wide range of material parameter variations.

J									Kolmanovsky,  Ilya V.		Drift Counteraction Control: Theory and Applications																												Awarded Grant	Aug 15 2014	2014	Drift Counteraction Control: Theory and Applications<br/>In many existing and emerging engineering systems there is an inherent tendency of process variables to drift. In some systems this drift is caused by large, persistent disturbances due to interactions with the external environment.  In other systems, similar drift is caused by finite resources (fuel, energy, component life etc.) being continuously depleted.  The operating objectives for such systems with drift are reflected in a set of constraints that must be satisfied for as long as possible by countering the drift, rather than in terms of usual set-point command tracking requirements.  This research project advances theory and methods for designing control algorithms that perform drift counteraction thereby establishing a foundation for addressing practical drift counteraction applications, and for incorporating drift counteraction technology into industrial products.   These advances will represent contributions to several areas of control theory including stochastic control, set-theoretic control, game-theoretic control, constrained control, and nonlinear control. The developments in theory will proceed in close synergy with the demonstration of their benefits in several engineering applications to automotive and aerospace systems and dynamic motion simulators. The research results will be integrated into university courses for graduate students, short courses for industrial and academic audiences, and into the computational software package implementing drift counteraction control design techniques.  <br/>The drift counteraction control is based primarily on constraints and does not use conventional set-points, differently from most of the traditional control theory.  The development of effective techniques for drift counteraction will be based on treating external disturbances causing drift and constraint violation first in the stochastic and then in the deterministic setting. In the stochastic setting, advances in Stochastic Drift Counteraction Optimal Control (SDCOC) that maximizes the expected cost before the imposed constraints are violated will be pursued.  Stability and boundness conditions for closed-loop trajectories of systems operating under SDCOC control laws when disturbances settle to constant values or vary within a subset of the full range will be derived. Sub-optimality and convergence properties of receding horizon and reinforcement learning variants of SDCOC will be studied. Advances in SDCOC computational procedures will be made, firstly, by exploiting decomposition of the system dynamics into slow and fast subsystems and, secondly, based on Markov Chain models that use Fuzzy Encoding (MCFE).  By combining SDCOC and MCFE, evidence based control framework for drift counteraction in uncertain systems will be defined and complemented with estimation algorithms.  In the deterministic setting, set-theoretic, game-theoretic and disturbance estimation/cancellation based approaches to drift counteraction problems will be pursued.  The advances will focus on formulation and derivation of algorithms, the improvements in their off-board and on-board computations, and characterization of closed-loop properties (constraint violation time, ability to prevent constraint violation over an infinite time interval, trajectory bounds, etc.).  Synergistically with the theoretical advances, several practical applications of drift counteraction control will be considered. These applications will include increasing comfort and fuel efficiency of adaptive cruise control systems for conventional and hybrid passenger vehicles, extending range and life of electric and hybrid electric vehicles and their batteries, improving the ability to replicate motions in small scale dynamic motion simulators, and improving the capability and efficiency of spacecraft attitude control using momentum exchange devices.  For each application, its requirements will be reflected in a drift counteraction problem formulation, appropriate models will be established, drift counteraction control algorithms will be designed, and performance benefits will be quantified. To ensure practical relevance of the results and facilitate their experimental validation in the vehicle adaptive cruise control case, interactions and collaborations with industry partners will be leveraged.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0						1404814								University of Michigan Ann Arbor				2023-12-08	GRANTS:13559021

Besides the obvious civil engineering infrastructure, thermal, electrical, mechanical, control, communication and computing subsystems must co-exist and be operated so that the overall operation is smooth and efficient. This is particularly important for commercial buildings but is also very relevant for residential buildings especially apartment buildings. Unfortunately, the design and deployment of these subsystems is rarely synchronized: lighting, security, heating, ventilation and air conditioning systems are often designed independently. However, simply putting together a collection of sub-systems, albeit optimized, has led to the inefficient buildings of today. Worldwide, buildings consume 42% of all electrical power - more than any other asset - and it can be proven that much of this can be reduced if a holistic approach to design, deployment, and operation is taken. Government agencies, academic institutions, building contractors and owners have realized the significant impact of buildings on the global environment, the electrical grid, and the mission of their organizations. However, the economic impact for all constituencies is still difficult to assess. Government regulations can play a fundamental role, as it has been the case for the transportation industry where regulations on emission and fuel consumption have been the single most important factor of innovation in automotive design. We are convinced that by leveraging technology and utilizing a system-level approach to buildings, they will provide comfort, safety and functionality while minimizing energy cost, supporting a robust electric grid and mitigating environmental impact. Realizing this vision requires adding intelligence from the beginning of the design phase, to deployment, from commissioning to operation, all the way to the end of the buildings life cycle. In this issue, we attempt to provide an as-complete-as-possible overview of the activities in the field of smart connected building design automation that attempts to make the vision a reality. The overarching range of such activities includes developing simulation tools for modeling and the design of buildings, and consequently control algorithms proposed to make buildings smarter and more efficient. Furthermore, we will review real-world and large-scale implementation of such control strategies on physical buildings. We then present a formal co-design methodology to design buildings, taking the view that buildings are prime examples of cyber-physical systems where the virtual and physical worlds meet as more traditional products such as thermostats are able to connect online and perform complicated computational tasks to control building temperature effectively. We complete the presentation describing the growing role of buildings in the operation of the smart grid where buildings are not only consumers of energy, but are themselves also providers of services and energy to the grid. The audiences for this monograph are industry professionals and researchers who work in the area of smart buildings, smart cities, and smart grid, with emphasis on energy efficiency, simulation tools, optimal control, and cyber-physical systems for the emerging power markets.									19	0	0	0	1	0	22			1551-3939											UC Berkeley, Berkeley, CA, USA				2016-06-16	INSPEC:16032136

The presented new technology of the diagnostics of hybrid powertrains allows an objective complex assessment of their technical condition by diagnostic parameters in contrast to existing diagnostic methods. In the proposed method, a mechanism for the general standardization of diagnostic parameters has been developed as well as for determining the numerical values of the parameters of the powertrain. The control subset was used to control the learning error. As a result of debugging the system, the scatter of experimental and calculated points has decreased, which confirms the quality of debugging the tested fuzzy model. As a result of training the artificial neural network, the standard deviation of the error in the control sample was 0.012 center dot P-k. A symmetry method of diagnostics of the technical state of a hybrid propulsion system was developed based on the concept of a neural network together with a neuro-fuzzy control with an adaptive criteria based on the method of training a neural network with reinforcement. The components of the vector functional include the criteria for control accuracy, the use of traction battery energy, and the degree of toxicity of exhaust gases. It is proposed to use the principle of symmetry of the guaranteed result and the linear inversion of the vector criterion into a supercriterion to determine the technical state of a hybrid powertrain on a set of Pareto-optimal controls under unequal conditions of optimality.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3				2073-8994										Kharkiv Natl Automobile & Highway Univ, Dept Tech Operat & Serv Automobiles, Yaroslava Mudrogo 25, UA-61002 Kharkiv, UkraineUniv Zilina, Dept Transport & Handling Machines, Univ 1, Zilina 01026, SlovakiaZhytomyr Polytech State Univ, Dept Automobile & Transport Technol, Chudnivska 103, UA-10005 Zhytomyr, UkraineKharkiv Petro Vasylenko Natl Tech Univ Agr, Dept Optimizat Technol Syst, Alchevsky 44, UA-61002 Kharkiv, UkraineKharkiv Petro Vasylenko Natl Tech Univ Agr, Dept Tractors & Automobiles, Yaroslava Mudrogo 25, UA-61002 Kharkiv, UkraineTernopil Ivan Puluj Natl Tech Univ, Dept Automobiles, Ruska 56, UA-46001 Ternopol, Ukraine				2022-01-09	WOS:000737514100001
